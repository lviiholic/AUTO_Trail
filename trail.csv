T01,P17,Aberdeen Country Park (Aberdeen Upper Reservoir) Accessible Route,Hong Kong Island,2,4,2,1,2.58,2,"Located in the Aberdeen Country Park, the Aberdeen Reservoirs consist of the Upper Aberdeen Reservoir and the Lower Aberdeen Reservoir. Built in 1890, the latter was formerly a private reservoir owned by Tai Shing Paper Factory until 1929, when it was bought by the government to increase water supply to Aberdeen and Ap Lei Chau; the Upper Aberdeen Reservoir was later constructed upstream of it. In 1932, the renovation and reconstruction of the two reservoirs was completed. Visitors can get off the bus on Yue Kwong Road and go uphill along Aberdeen Reservoir Road. The dam of the Upper Reservoir, which lies in the woodlands, comes into view shortly after. To reach it, visitors can set out along the broad and well-shaded path, which offers the scenic beauty of the dam and passes through Aberdeen P.H.A.B. Site. The site is an ideal place for rest and refreshments as it has a light refreshment kiosk, an accessible barbecue site, and toilet. As soon as they arrive at the destination, they can explore the bridge, valve house and dam of the reservoir, which are all declared monuments."
T02,P17,Aberdeen Nature Trail,Hong Kong Island,1,1,1,1,1.2,1,"The first leg of Aberdeen Nature Trail skirts along Lower Aberdeen Reservoir on a level path. Once privately owned by a papermill, the reservoir was surrendered to the government for modification as part of the Aberdeen Valley Water Scheme and came into use again in 1932. The nature trail overlooks fine vistas of the typhoon shelter in Aberdeen and affords glimpses of a catholic convent built in a blend of Chinese and Italian architectural styles, as well as the rich diversity of flora and fauna, including Sasagrass, an ingredient of 24 Herbs, Chinese Cane, which is used to wrap sticky rice dumplings, and Black Kite soaring overhead. Near the end of the trail there is an old-style rain gauge, a declared monument of Upper Aberdeen Reservoir, which is certainly not to be missed."
T03,P17,Aberdeen Tree Walk,Hong Kong Island,1,3,2,1,2.5,1.2,"Aberdeen Tree Walk lies near the downtown area and takes about 10 minutes’ walk from the centre of Aberdeen. To nearby residents, the green haven is a cherished “Backyard Garden of Hong Kong Island”. The Tree Walk is 2.5km long, established along Aberdeen Reservoir Road. It traverses Aberdeen Country Park before reaching the exit of Wan Chai Gap. The Tree Walk is overgrown with green trees, including such local native plants as Rhodoleia with bell-like flowers and Soft-fruited Ormosia with candy-like seeds."
T04,P22,Ap Chau Geosite,North New Territories,1,3,1,1,1,1,"Located to the east of Sha Tau Kok, Ap Chau, which literally means ‘duck island’, got its name because it looks like a duck on water. Composed of red breccia, which is rare in Hong Kong, this small island boasts rich geological culture and human touch with some famous geological attractions, including ‘Duck’s Eye’, which was formed as a result of prolonged wave erosion, and ‘Duck’s Neck’, which is made up of a fault zone. In the 1930s, when Ap Chau was still a deserted island, it was an anchorage for fishermen who fished in nearby waters to fix and repair their fishing tackle and fishing boats. As more people went there, a fishing community gradually took shape, and later built huts, a church, and village schools on the island, with a population of one thousand inhabitants at its height. At present, the island has lost most of its population and in 2018 the school was converted into Ap Chau Story Room, which promotes the history and culture of the island."
T05,P21,Bride's Pool Nature Trail,North New Territories,1,3,1,2,0.7,0.75,"Located at the northwestern corner of Plover Cove Country Park, Bride’s Pool Nature Trail meanders along the valley and skirts along cascades. The trail is easy to walk and ideal for families who want to go on a hike at weekends. In addition to the spectacular waterfalls, there are other hot spots for social media check-ins. One example is the pot-holes of Bride’s Pool. These natural wonders are formed when water, as well as small pebbles, continuously tumbles onto the cracks on rocks of the river bed, which eventually erode away and expand into potholes. With such impressive scenery, Bride’s Pool also has tales to tell about the origin of its name. Legend has it that a bride fell into the pool and lost her life on the way to the wedding because the wedding sedan-chair porter lost his footing. Since then, the pool has been referred to as Bride’s Pool. It is also said that the bride’s vanity mirror gave a nearby waterfall the name ‘Mirror Pool Waterfall’. The nature trail passes by the hundred-year-old Bride’s Pool Stone Bridge, which was built in 1906 to enable villagers to commute between Wu Kau Tang and Chung Mei Village conveniently."
T06,P10,Cheung Sheung Country Trail,Sai Kung,3,2,3,2,4.2,3,"Cheung Sheung, surrounded by steep spurs, is one of those rare marshes situated on a plateau.  The word ‘Cheung’ and the uniquely magnificent views stem from the surrounding layers of mountains.  Located in Sai Kung West Country Park, the trail presents hikers with scenes of Shek Uk Shan, the highest crest in Sai Kung, and Cheung Sheung Plateau, along Hoi Ha Road to the peak.  On the return trip, the trail amazes hikers with a panoramic view of the Three Fathoms Cove on the west.  Cheung Sheung Village owns a shabby stone house, an abandoned rainfall measurement station and an old village school that was used by anti-Japanese Guerrillas as a communications base.  The derelict village school holds on to history that cannot be forgotten among Hongkongers.  To arrive Yung Shue O Village, the destination of the trip, hikers have to go through the challenge of passing through series of steep and long stone steps, known as Jacob’s Ladder, situated at Au Mun.  If you are ready to take the challenge to the next level physically and mentally, you can get to Cheung Sheung with a reverse route that requires climbing up Jacob’s Ladder."
T07,P15,Chi Ma Wan Country Trail,Lantau,4,3,2,4,18.5,8,"Chi Ma Wan Country Trail, with a total distance of 18.5 kilometres, shares the same starting and ending point at Shap Long Campsite.  The trail surrounds most of Chi Ma Wan Peninsula, offering hikers vistas of Pui O Bay, Ham Tin Village and Cheung Sha.  Since the trail skirts along the coastline, weathering has given the rocks an extraordinary look, and thus in the vicinity there is a famous spot called ‘Rock Wonder’, where granites in unique shapes scatter around hillsides.  Up at the peak of Lo Yan Shan, which is 306 metres high, hikers would be stunned by the 360-degree panorama of Tsing Ma Bridge, International Commerce Centre and International Finance Centre (on clear days).  Given its awe-inspiring natural landscapes and captivating city views, the route never fails to attract tourists even though it takes visitors as long as 8 hours to complete the trip.  It is rewarding to explore the peninsula through hiking and taking glimpses of the sea."
T08,P03,Chuen Lung Family Walk,West New Territories,1,2,1,1,0.5,0.5,"Situated on a mountain in Tsuen Wan, Chuen Lung is an ancient Hakka village, as well as a resting place for hikers to enjoy Dim Sum. Chuen Lung Family Walk is suitable for families to have a barbecue and go on a hike as it is located inside a barbecue site near the entrance of the village. The entrance arch stands alongside Brisbane Box, a special tree species which blossoms from May to July and fruits semiglobose capsules from August to September. Along the trail, there are also Shiny-leaved Prickly Ash, which has pricks on the main vein of both sides of its leaves, Divaricate Strophanthus, which bears poisonous fruits that resemble goat horns, and Sandpaper Vine, which was used by villagers to clean cooking utensils. In the vicinity is a viewing point overlooking Tsuen Wan, with views of Tsing Yi and Lantau Island in the distance. The trip finishes as the trail traverses a group of bamboo nearby. With a span of half a kilometre only, it can be easily finished even by young and elderly family members. In summer, you may also catch sight of the star of Chuen Lung – Yellow Coster, a rare species in Hong Kong. The plant its larvae feed on, Ramie, can also be found by the sides of the stream."
T09,P21,Chung Pui Tree Walk,North New Territories,1,3,1,1,0.25,0.2,"Chung Pui Tree Walk is a circular route with 0.25km in length, established beside Brides’ Pool Road. 14 species of trees are introduced along the Tree Walk, including Pop-Gun Seed, Chinese Tallow Tree and Acronychia. The Tree Walk is located at the foot of Hsien Ku Fung and close to Plover Cove Reservoir. Visitors can enjoy the splendid scenery of Plover Cove Reservoir while learning about various tree species."
T10,P20,Clear Water Bay Tree Walk,Sai Kung,1,2,1,2,1.2,0.5,"Clear Water Bay Tree Walk is cutting across dense woodlands in the mid slopes of Tai Hang Tun in Clear Water Bay Country Park. There is a viewing platform and a visitor centre at the start of the Tree Walk. Looking southeast from the platform, you will see the magnificent waves patting Tsing Chau and Nine Pin Group. Walk several dozen steps along the tree walk, you will feel as if you were in a forest, feeling cool even in hot summer days. After passing through the luxuriant trees, you will get to the open section in the middle of the Tree Walk. Looking south, you will see the fascinating Clear Water Bay and the nostalgic, peaceful and simple fishing village - Po Toi O. Measuring 1.2 km in length, Clear Water Bay Tree Walk has 10 interpretation plates with information on various plants like Chinese Hackberry, Laurel Sweet Leaf and Schima.1 Schefflera heptaphylla2 Machilus thunbergii3 Macaranga tanarius var tomentosa4 Schima superba5 Symplocos cochinchinensis var. laurina6 Ficus hispida7 Alangium chinense8 Bridelia tomentosa9 Litsea glutinosa10 Celtis sinensis"
T11,P21,Double Haven Country Trail,North New Territories,3,2,2,2,13.2,6,"Some people say the history of Hong Kong is all about migration; in particular, Hakka culture plays a major role in it. Located on the northeastern shore of Plover Cove Country Park, Lai Chi Wo is home to a well-preserved Hakka walled village with a history of more than 400 years. A place of scenic beauty, it features geological wonders, natural habitats, ancient villages, and Hakka Culture. The starting point Wu Kau Tang was once called ‘Wu Kwai Tin’, which literally means Tortoise Field, but villagers replaced ‘Kwai’ with ‘Kau’ for its auspicious meaning. As of today, the tortoises have long gone, but the clean water of the streams in the forest has provided a habitat for various species of insects, making it a popular destination to see dragonflies in summer. On the coast of Sam A Chung, Yan Chau Tong Marine Park comes into full view. The pink colour of the bay is given by the extremely high iron content in the sandstone, the oxidation condition of which was strengthened by high temperature when the strata were being formed. Not only does Lai Chi Wo offer beautiful coastal scenery, a taste of Hakka culture in walled villages, and traditional delicacies, but it is also home to many special old trees, including Autumn Maple, whose trunk is hollow, the primeval Heritiera woods, which are the largest of their kind in the territory, Small-fruited Fig, whose aerial roots hold onto Autumn Maple, and the Five-fingered Camphor Tree, a ‘finger’ of which was unfortunately cut down by the Japanese forces during the Japanese occupation."
T12,P23,Eagle's Nest Nature Trail,Central New Territories,1,2,1,1,3,1.5,"Eagle’s Nest, also known as Tsim Shan, is located inside Lion Rock Country Park near Shek Lei Pui Reservoir. On Eagle’s Nest, Black Kite, a commonly seen raptor, can easily be spotted hovering overhead. Eagle’s Nest Nature Trail is close to urban areas and suitable for families. Near the start point of the trail, vistas of Kowloon Reservoir come into view; in the middle part, there is a pavilion that looks out on the central part of Kowloon. Views of outstanding scenic beauty stretch as far as the eye can see – visitors can catch sight of Diamond Hill, Kowloon Tong, So Uk, and Beacon Hill. Further ahead, a delightful panoramic view of mountains in Central New Territories like Kam Shan, Smuggler’s Ridge, Tai Mo Shan, and Needle Hill can be seen. The nature trail also features Shiuying Bamboo, which is named after Hong Kong botanist Dr. Hu Shiuying. First discovered in Tsim Shan in 1981, Shiuying Bamboo is a native Poaceae plant. This flora species is a delight to look at, as it frequently has purple spots between internodes when young and grows with bright green leaves in multi-stemmed clumps. Graceful and elegant, it certainly lives up to its name."
T13,P15,Fan Lau Country Trail,Lantau,1,3,1,2,2,1,"The multicultural facet of Hong Kong could be manifested in Fan Lau Country Trail. Situated in the southernmost area of Lantau Island, Fan Lau Country Trail exhibits a blend of historical characteristics.  Tracing Section 8 of Lantau Trail backwards from Shek Pik leads through the hill paths to the long and narrow stretch of Fan Lau Tung Wan, with the monument Fan Lau Fort at its end.  As recorded in literature of the Ming Dynasty, the site once held 20 barracks and 8 cannons while the existing site was constructed in the latter years of Emperor Kangxi’s reign in the Qing Dynasty – it is little wonder that touring Fan Lau Country Trail gives hikers a sense of what time travel is like.  Continuing from the fort would bring you to Fan Lau Kok, where you can see the magnificent scene of muddy waters of the Pearl River merging with clear blue sea waters coming from the east – a must-visit spot for photography lovers. Apart from the fort and borders of waters, there is a path leading to Stone Circle, which has a longer history than the fort – it can be traced back to the late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age.  The stones appear to be laid out in an oval shape, remaining intact and highly valuable for appreciation."
T14,P04,Fu Tei Country Trail,West New Territories,2,3,0,2,4,2,"For the many places whose historical side has been swallowed up by towering skyscrapers, names are all that is left.  One such example is Fu Tei, Tuen Mun, where, according to legend, tigers could be spotted.  The pity of it is that the truth of it will always remain a mystery. A little distance ahead, the sound of rushing water of Fu Tei Hang stream can be heard. Just above Fu Tei Hang along the hill, the level and well-shaded Fu Tei Country Trail lies.  At the end of the stream sits Lam Tei Irrigation Reservoir, which was put into service in 1957.  It is a long and narrow lake.  In autumn, the hills behind the trees turn golden in the breeze, reflected together with the azure sky in the placid waters of the lake.  Its dam is also long and narrow, so when looked back at the dam, the reservoir is like a long river deep into the woods and mountains.  The hike is never complete without paying a visit to the monument erected next to the dam, which was inscribed ‘Lo Fu Hang Dam, Hung Shui Hang, Yuen Long, the New Territories’ and unveiled by the then Governor of Hong Kong Sir Alexander William George Herder Grantham.  This provides proof that the stream was once called ‘Lo Fu Hang’; the question now is, ‘is the legend about tigers being around true?’"
T15,P21,Fung Hang Family Walk,North New Territories,1,3,1,1,2,0.75,"Visitors are a rarity in many border regions, but it is these areas that provide a habitat for a wealth of wildlife. The same is true of Hong Kong. During spring and summer, Sha Tau Kok Hoi, in which the famous egretry in A Chau is situated, houses huge flocks of egrets and herons, an easily spotted species of waterfowl that perches on wetlands. They can be seen foraging for food by flying low to the ground from Fung Hang Family Walk, which is set by the sea. As soon as the trail enters the woodland, it reaches a viewing point on a knoll, overlooking the wetlands formed by the villages and fields in Kai Kuk Shue Ha, Fung Hang, and Nam Hang Mei. Thanks to the mountain ranges that separate this place from the hustle and bustle of the city, it has become an unspoilt paradise for animals and us."
T16,P12,High Island Geo Trail,Sai Kung,2,3,2,2,4.3,3,"Geological wonders are not necessarily situated on remote outlying islands. Some world-class landforms lie at the High Island Reservoir east dam, which is just a 40-minute drive from Sai Kung Town Centre. On one side of the dam is the man-made reservoir, which is the largest of all in Hong Kong in terms of capacity; on the other side are some spectacular hexagonal rock columns formed some 140 million years ago as mixtures of lava, detritus, volcanic ashes contracted during the cooling period after the frequent volcanic activities. They appear in an S-pattern because the columns were still contracting while a tectonic shift was taking place. As you walk along the trail towards the sea, you can see Po Pin Chau, which looks like a piece of cake. It was once part of Fa Shan, but was cut away from it because of years of wave impact, giving the flank of Po Pin Chau a row of sea stacks that look as if they were cut with a knife with a serrated blade. Don’t miss out on the wooden bridge at the east dam, which allows you to take a close look at the sea cave."
T17,P12,High Junk Peak Country Trail,Sai Kung,3,2,3,3,6.4,3,"Soaring at an altitude of 344 metres with pointed edges, High Junk Peak, the highest summit in Clearwater Bay Peninsula, is crowned as one of the three steepest climbs in Sai Kung along with Sharp Peak and Tai Yue Ngam Teng in Sai Kung East Country Park.  High Junk Peak Country Trail passes several bays, including Port Shelter, Clearwater Bay, as well as Joss House Bay, and runs through Clearwater Bay Country Park from the north to the south.  The path lays along ridges that separates Tseung Kwan O New Town from rural beauty, displaying how close country trails are to us.  If you look up at the 344-metre High Junk Peak from the hillside, the sloping mountain resembles an Indian tent.  Some say the mountain looks like a fisherman with a straw cape and a conical hat, which explains how High Junk Peak got its name.  Walking along the path towards Tin Ha Shan, you will be embraced by blue sky, turquoise water, and the surrounding mountains. On any clear days, you may even be able to view Ninepin Group and Basalt Island that are on the east of the city.  Near the ending point of the route is Joss House Bay, which holds a Tin Hau Temple that was built in 1266 and the most ancient local rock inscription, which was carved in 1274 in Southern Song period.  The inscription depicts the scene of salt administration officers visiting Fat Tong Mun with their friends and the history of the old temple."
T18,P06,Ho Pui Reservoir Family Walk,West New Territories,1,2,1,1,2.1,1,"Located inside Tai Lam Country Park, Ho Pui Reservoir is an irrigation reservoir in Pat Heung, Yuen Long that feeds the fields in northwest New Territories. Compared to other large reservoirs, Ho Pui Reservoir bears a closer to a small lake in the mountains. When the water level is high, the submerged forests and the islets are like a gigantic sea turtle that has its emerald carapace emerged on the water surface. Apart from the gentle uphill slope before the entrance, the trail consists of level muddy paths that are easy to walk on. Towards the end is one of the very few S-shaped dams in Hong Kong. It sits nicely between artificial splendour and natural beauty, with a 17.4-metre outfall on one side and an oasis surrounded by water on the other. In the proximity to the family walk, there are campsites and organic farms, making it an ideal place for families to get close to nature."
T19,P01,Hok Tau Country Trail,North New Territories,2,2,2,2,2.5,1,"Offering a rare but pastoral scene with many farmhouses and farms that produce a type of local cabbages, Hok Tau is a great place for family weekend trips.  The entrance of Hok Tau Country Trail is a neatly arranged area of plantations.  The opening section of the trail stretches across ridges that lead up to a lookout overlooking Hok Tau, Lung Yeuk Tau, and Fanling.  Along the ridges there are also many villages and village houses, with some fields, each having their own characteristics, open to visitors and filled with children’s cheers and laughter.  By the side of Hok Tau Village is a huge piece of farmland, which is sowed with papayas, bitter melons, and fruits and vegetables in season, and where various kinds of dragonflies are seen in summer.  Kids will no doubt have great fun identifying crops and insects."
T20,P01,Hok Tau Reservoir Family Walk,North New Territories,1,3,1,1,2.5,1,"Located inside Pat Sin Leng Country Park, Hok Tau Reservoir was once an area of streams and marshes with abundant water supply and therefore an irrigation reservoir was built there in 1968. For those who opt for doing things one step at a time, follow the left trail by strolling on a gentle uphill footpath; for those who likes to make haste, take the right route on what is famously known as the ‘68 steps’ in one go. Whichever route you take, you will be rewarded with vistas of the reservoir down the mountains at the top of Pat Sin Leng Country Park. Despite a capacity of 0.18 million cubic metres only, the reservoir is narrow and full of twists and turns. Skirting along the reservoir, the family walk features a picturesque bridge arching over running river. At certain heights, it offers an aerial view of the reservoir and the dam. Since the reservoir is located in the valley with plentiful water supply, it is home to many species of butterflies and dragonflies, including the rare Macromidia ellenae and the only freshwater fish species named after the territory Macropodus hongkongensis. There are barbecue sites and campsites around the family walk, making it an ideal place for families to get close to nature."
T21,P26,Hong Kong Trail (Section 1)The Peak to Pok Fu Lam Reservoir Road,Hong Kong Island,2,3,2,2,7,2,"The bird’s eye view of Victoria Harbour from Victoria Peak is unquestionably Hong Kong’s most iconic view.  Apart from the pavilion scene often featured on postcards, an even more sweeping vista is offered at the start point of the Hong Kong Trail, Lugard Road.  Built between 1913 and 1914 with some narrow, cliff-side paths called plank roads, the hundred-year-old trail is named after the 14th Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Frederick Lugard. Not only is it a great spot to admire sunset and night views, it is also where you can witness the extraordinary scene of our city enveloped in mist in spring. The Peak Trail is surrounded by lush forestry and moss-covered rocks, dotted with a variety of flora species throughout the year – between April and May pink flowers of the Lance-leaved Sterculia, come into bloom; from July to October white flowers of the Turn-in-the-wind, embellish the trail.  Together with antique stone benches and streetlights, it exudes an air of ancient elegance. Continue on to Harlech Road, which is to the southwest of Victoria Peak, and then stroll along the shaded tree-lined trail at Pok Fu Lam Reservoir.  It will instantly connect you from the bustling financial centre to a rural idyll on the western part of Hong Kong Island, which is yet another way to tell the stories of Hong Kong."
T22,P26,Hong Kong Trail (Section 2)Pok Fu Lam Reservoir Road to Peel Rise,Hong Kong Island,2,4,2,3,4.5,1.5,"The second leg of the Hong Kong Trail starts at Pok Fu Lam Reservoir, the first reservoir in Hong Kong, which was completed in 1863 and extended in 1877 to meet the needs of the residents on Hong Kong Island.  With abundant water resources, as well as secondary forests in the catchment area and streams, it is home to a good many forest birds and insects, such as the pale thrush, the black-crowned night heron, and the Hainan blue flycatcher, filling the trail section with vibrancy and vitality especially in spring and summer.  Besides a vehicular road and a path, there is a trail ride, with pavilions and long benches in the vicinity as rest stops.  At the far end of the trail ride is a viewing platform that commands the view of Aberdeen and Lamma Island.  Towards the end of Section 2, the trail descends to Tin Wan, where the trail and skyscrapers are in close proximity to each other.  This is a distinctive characteristic of Hong Kong’s countryside – the country is just a stone’s throw away from the city.  At the finishing point, you will hear the stream gurgling down Keung Fa Kan, where the short-legged toad – an endangered species native to Hong Kong – was found."
T23,P17,Hong Kong Trail (Section 3) Peel Rise to Wan Chai Gap,Hong Kong Island,2,2,1,1,6.5,1.75,"Street names in Hong Kong provide a window into the history of our city.  One such example is Peel Rise, which was named after the 18th Governor of Hong Kong.  Section 3 of the Hong Kong Trail starts here and begins with a brief ascent, but after pouring in the rainy season during the summer months you will be rewarded with the refreshing sight of a small cascade at a stream named Keung Fa Kan.  Continue on to the level tree-shaded dirt path, you will be greeted with a variety of species of ferns and mosses along the trailside.  Further into the woodland, you can catch a glimpse of the Aberdeen Upper Reservoir and the Aberdeen Lower Reservoir, which were completed in the 1930s.  The Aberdeen Lower Reservoir, built in 1890, was once privately owned by Tai Shing Paper Manufacturing Company and later bought and expanded by the government to solve the problem of water shortages in the western part of Hong Kong Island.  The granite-built dam, the valve house reminiscent of Renaissance architecture, and the arch bridge of the Aberdeen Upper Reservoir are declared monuments as well as popular photo spots among hikers."
T24,P17,Hong Kong Trail (Section 4)Wan Chai Gap to Wong Nai Chung Gap,Hong Kong Island,2,2,2,2,7.5,2,"If there is a place to learn all about the flora and the history of Hong Kong, it has to be its countryside.  Section 4 of the Hong Kong Trail starts at Lady Clementi’s Ride, which was named after the wife of the 17th Governor of Hong Kong Sir Cecil Clementi.  Traversing Aberdeen Reservoirs, the tree-shaded path is home to a great many species of insects and birds.  If you walk on to Wan Chai Gap and cross the two delicate English bridges there, you will see native tree species like Ivy Tree, Turn-in-the-wind, Reevesia, and Incense Tree.  Incense Tree, which got its name because of its fragrant incense, was once a timber export so important that it is said to be the origin of Hong Kong’s name.  Blessed with abundant water resources, the mature secondary forests and Aberdeen Reservoirs house different species of birds, such as the whistling thrush, the Chinese hwamei, the greater necklaced laughingthrush, and the fork-tailed sunbird.  The route comes to an end at Wong Nai Chung Gap.  Surviving war relics can be found here in this important battlefield of the Second World War."
T25,P05,Hong Kong Trail (Section 5)Wong Nai Chung Gap to Mount Parker Road,Hong Kong Island,3,3,3,4,4,1.5,"Section 5 of the trail begins at Wong Nai Chung Reservoir.  The construction of the reservoir was one of the measures to improve water supply resources in the wake of the outbreak of plague in 1894.  Completed in 1899, the reservoir was originally operated as an ancillary water source to the Tai Tam Group of Reservoirs but later rendered superfluous by several larger reservoirs in the 1960s.    Its surviving waterworks construction including the dam, the valve house, and the weir are classified as declared monuments.  Section 5 of the Hong Kong Trail stretches for 4 kilometres only, but is steeply undulating, leading up to the summit of Jardine’s Lookout and the summit of Mount Butler.  The two summits afford some of the best views of Hong Kong – the former, at an elevation of over 400 metres, commands sweeping vistas of Victoria Harbour and downtown Kowloon, while the latter overlooks Lamma Island, Tai Tam Bay, and Stanley in the southern part of Hong Kong Island.  Alternating between climbs and descents, the trail ends with a flight of 599 steps, make sure you are physically and mentally fit to complete this section!"
T26,P04,Hong Kong Trail (Section 6) Mount Parker Road to Tai Tam Road,Hong Kong Island,2,2,3,1,4.5,1.5,"Section 6 of the Hong Kong Trail starts at Quarry Gap at an elevation of over 300 metres.  The towering trees by the sides of Mount Parker Road form a canopy of leaves that spreads all the way to the road, blocking out the sun and providing natural cooling, as if the path were air conditioned.  At the main dam of Tai Tam Upper Reservoir, the picture-postcard views of azure blue water and verdant hills come into sight, creating a sense of soothing tranquillity; the hundred-year-old main dam and masonry bridge, distinctive of Victorian architecture, are also worthy of appreciation – they are a feast for the eyes."
T27,P09,Hong Kong Trail (Section 7) Tai Tam Road to To Tei Wan,Hong Kong Island,2,3,2,1,7.5,2,"Section 7 is one of the easiest sections of the entire Hong Kong Trail.  The beginning of the trail is surrounded with trees, but further down the trail the vista is gradually less unobstructed.  Follow the Tai Tam East catchwater at the start point and you will be greeted with the delightful scenery of Tai Tam Bay and Red Hill Peninsula.  At weekends the otherwise serene Tai Tam Bay, which affords the views of Stanley Peninsula in the distance, is animated by crowds coming for water sports on its clear water.  Continuing on to the second half of the section, you will arrive in Lan Nai Wan Village, where ramshackle village houses remind you of the rustic peace and simplicity of the fishing village in days gone by.  Skirting along the hillside for the most part, the trail is an easy hike until beyond the catchwater near the finishing point, where it becomes increasingly precipitous – it first descends for dozens of metres and then leads up for some one hundred metres, which adds a bit of spice to the hike!"
T28,P09,Hong Kong Trail (Section 8)To Tei Wan to Tai Long Wan,Hong Kong Island,3,2,3,4,8.5,2.75,"Hong Kong Island is surrounded by sea, so stretches of coastline come into full view when you gaze in the distance from high ground.  The last as well as the longest section of the Hong Kong Trail is popular among hikers as it spans Dragon’s Back, which was hailed by international magazines as Asia’s best urban hike.  Walk uphill for about 200 metres at the start point at an elevation of over one hundred metres, and then follow the sign for Shek O Peak at 284 metres.  From there, you will see the undulating hills that extend all the way to Wan Cham Shan resemble the shape of a dragon’s back, which justifies its name.  The viewing point at the top boasts a superb panorama of Shek O, Tung Lung Island, Stanley, and Tai Tam.  The trail then joins a forest path at the hillside of Wan Cham Shan, where you can immerse yourself in tranquillity and serenity blessed by nature as the woodland hums to a beat of rustling leaves, twittering birds, and buzzing insects.  Further up in the shaded path of Mount Collinson, you can enjoy a sweeping vista from Chai Wan to Tseung Kwan O on the opposite shore.  Follow the trail downhill as soon as you arrive at Pottinger Gap, and it will lead you to the finishing point of the Hong Kong Trail – Big Wave Bay."
T29,P05,Hong Pak Country Trail,Hong Kong Island,2,3,2,2,3.3,1.25,"Situated around Quarry Bay and Tai Koo Shing, Hong Pak Country Trail not only brings you green vistas of the surrounding mountain ranges and scenes of birds chirping and flowers blooming, but also interesting looking rocks scattering along the path.  Through careful observation and imagination, “Dinosaur Rock” could be spotted.  The trail also offers a full view of the cityscape of Quarry Bay and its neighbouring areas, giving hikers magnificent feelings of being surrounded by the oasis of the city.  Don’t be surprised if you hear owls calling along the trail at dusk.  Since the finishing point of Hong Pak Country trail is connected with Quarry Bay Tree Walk, after finishing Hong Pak Country Trail, you can carry on with the Tree Walk and get a grasp of different species of trees, such as Oblong-leaved Litsea, Hong Kong Gordonia, and Yellow Cow Wood.  What is more, you can follow Mount Parker Road and drop by Woodside Biodiversity Education Centre, also known as ‘Red House’, where you can get to learn the natural environment and the biodiversity of the territory at its exhibition gallery.  Together with the classic design of the building, the place cannot be more tempting for visitors."
T30,P23,Hung Mui Kuk Nature Trail,Central New Territories,1,3,1,1,1.3,1,"Between spring and summer, visitors to Hung Mui Kuk are bound to fall into a fanciful reverie that strawberry Trees are scattered all over the mountain and the valley, which is how Hung Mui Kuk got its name. Located inside Lion Rock Country Park, Hung Mui Kuk Nature Trail overall is an easy hike, with some gentle ascending slopes despite a treacherous first half. Although Hung Mui Kuk is just separated from the town by a mountain, the scenes are as different as chalk and cheese. Long aerial roots of Chinese Banyan can be seen swaying in the wind near the start point; another special plant featured along the trail such as Lychee. The luxuriant vegetation in the valley is not only pleasing to the eye, but also purifies the air. Entertaining and educational, the trail is suitable for families. The trip is never complete without visiting Amah Rock, one of the mountain landmarks in Hong Kong. To reach it, follow the stairs on the right at the finishing point of the trail and ascend for some distance. The 30-feet Amah Rock was originally a massive rock erecting on the mountain but later split into two unevenly because of weathering. As the rock resembles a child on an adult’s back, together with the imagination of villagers and legends of fishing villages in Hong Kong, the legend that a woman carrying her child on her back waiting for her husband’s return becomes a story that everyone knows."
T31,P14,Kam Shan Family Walk,Central New Territories,1,2,1,2,1,0.5,"Monkeys in Hong Kong do not live in Water Curtain Cave; most of them are found in Kam Shan, or commonly known as Monkey Hill. Starting at Kowloon Reservoir and Shek Lei Pui Reservoir, Kam Shan Family Walk is an uphill shady path mainly consisting of stairs. It can look back on Kowloon Reservoir and is very popular among morning walkers. It winds back to Golden Hill Road, which is one of the few places in Hong Kong where people can get close to macaques. Macaques, although not aggressive, may get out of control and snatch food from people. It is therefore important to keep an eye on your food and bags, and remember not to feed them or get too close to them."
T32,P14,Kam Shan Tree Walk,Central New Territories,1,3,1,1,1,0.5,"Kam Shan Tree Walk is located in Kam Shan Country Park, with the entrance set at Kowloon Reservoir. The Tree Walk links to Stage 6 of MacLehose Trail at Golden Hill Road, and creates a beautiful scenery with the adjoining Kowloon Byewash Reservoir. The Tree Walk is 1km long and lined by a rich variety of tree species. A total of 15 interpretation plates are put up to help you appreciate and learn about trees, including Acronychia, Lingnan Garcinia and Silver-back Artocarpus."
T33,P03,Kap Lung Ancient Trail Country Trail,West New Territories,2,2,4,3,2,1,"With its name originating from Kap Lung Village, Kap Lung Ancient Trail is one of those the old trails with a long history. Kap Lung Village, which is only home to 2 households currently, has a span of history of more than 2 centuries. Bridging Kap Lung and Tsuen Kam Au, Kap Lung Ancient Trail was once a major commuting route that allowed farmers who lived around Pat Heung and Shek Kong to travel to and from Tsuen Wan Market. Every single step of the well-preserved path was built of granite. Seasonal characteristics of the path are further enhanced by the presence of, Chinese New Year Flower, Giant Alocasia, Camel’s Foot Tree, Tree Cotton, and Ivory Coral Tree. In summer, the path is exceptionally lush, cool, and cozy, giving city-dwellers a rarely pleasant experience. The second half of the country trail is more physically demanding as it is made of well-retained stone staircases, while the beginning of the country trail overlaps Kap Lung Forest Trail. Given that the whole path is located in the woods, however, hikers can sit in the shade of trees and take a rest on sunny days. All in all, Kap Lung Village is quite an easy walk."
T34,P22,Kat O Heritage Trail,North New Territories,2,4,2,4,3.5,2,"Kat O is the biggest island in the northeast New Territories. Characterised by a curvy shape and deep bays, it is a natural shelter, reflected in its name, which means Lucky Harbour. Kat O takes pride in its long history and rich heritage, and there are many cultural heritage sites to explore. Once an economic hub in the Mirs Bay region, Kat O remains a scenic island with many sites of natural beauty. Indeed, it is celebrated as the “Pearl of Mirs Bay”."
T35,P19,Kei Ling Ha Tree Walk,Sai Kung,1,3,1,2,0.65,0.5,"Kei Ling Ha Tree Walk is located in Ma On Shan Country Park and starts at Shui Long Wo, Sai Sha Road. This tree walk is 0.65km long. Interpretation plates are placed to highlight 7 common species in the countryside, including Common Red-stem Fig, Elephant’s Ear and Lance-leaved Sterculia. At the barbecue site near the start of the Tree Walk, there is a 10m height astronomical observation terrace where you can watch the charming starry night.1 Viburnum odoratissimum2 Claoxylon indicum3 Sterculia lanceolata4 Bridelia tomentosa5 Aquilaria sinensis6 Rhus succedanea7 Macaranga tanarius var. tomentosa"
T36,P07,Keung Shan Country Trail,Lantau,3,3,3,3,8.2,3,"Keung Shan Country Trail goes down south at Fan Shui Au before reaching the Kau Ling Chung Catchwater.  The entire footpath, paved with mountain rocks, is full of natural characteristics.  To the north is the spectacular Che Hing Monastery, hidden in a pine forest like an Arcadia, as well as Lung Tsai Ng Yuen, set in magnificent mountainous scenery.  The stroll down to the catchwater is level and pleasant.  Located 200 metres from the trail, Kau Ling Chung Campsite boasts a fine white beach, and a picturesque setting of bridges arching over running river with shady trees in the surroundings.  On a knoll to its east stand a viewing point and the South Lantau Obelisk.  Specifically, the obelisk stands on a hill 60 metres above Kau Ling Chung, surrounded by the sea on its three sides with a wide view.  It was erected in 1902 by British Military subsequent to the signing of the Sino-British Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory on 9 June 1898 to mark the boundary."
T37,P10,Lai Chi Chong Geosite,Sai Kung,1,3,1,2,1,1,"Roaming the countryside has become an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city for many city-dwellers. Lai Chi Chong, located on the southeastern shore of Tolo Channel, is an arcadia popular among hikers. With shoreside mangroves, and rocks of varying colours by the shore and under the water, it offers a getaway from the hustle of cosmopolitan life. The rocks of the Lai Chi Chong coast were made up of compacted volcanic ash mixed with mud and sand in the crater lakes or nearby lakebeds. Layer upon layer of volcanic ashes, overlain by the mud and sand in the lakebeds, produces coarser-grained beddings of varying colours of alternate shades. Folding, faulting and slump structures in the lakebed, which are caused by the frequent earthquakes in the volcanic field, together with the calm bay, are a rare landform. To take a good look at the rocks, don’t forget to check the tidal information before setting off and go when the tide is low."
T38,P21,Lai Chi Wo Nature Trail,North New Territories,1,3,1,1,1.2,1,"Located in the Double Haven Geo-Area, Lai Chi Wo Nature Trail passes through an old Hakka village. It is the best place to get close to wildlife in Lai Chi Wo, and explore Hakka culture and history. As the largest Hakka village in North East New Territories in the 1950s and the 1960s, Lai Chi Wo had 211 village houses, all of which were built with nine narrow horizontal lanes and three vertical lanes for traditional Hakka fung shui reasons. Behind the village are the Fung Shui Woods, which are home to more than 100 species of trees and butterflies. Some trees are even rare in Hong Kong. Most of the houses were left to stand derelict, but the ecology and the geology there have drawn many tourists, injecting life into the village again. The trail also features some unique-looking trees and a diverse collection of wildlife. For example, hikers will be greeted with Five-fingered Camphor and century-old Hollow Tree, Autumn Maple. At the entrance of the village, they will also be welcomed by White-flowered Derris, mangroves, mudskippers in mudflats, and Dwarf Eel Grass, the biggest seagrass bed recorded in the northeast waters of Hong Kong."
T39,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 1) Mui Wo to Nam Shan,Lantau,1,4,1,1,2.5,0.75,"The first leg of the Lantau Trail runs parallel to South Lantau Road.  Along the way, the footpath overlooks several villages, namely Luk Tei Tong Village, Tai Tei Tong, Pak Ngan Heung, Mui Wo Kau Tsuen, and Chung Hau.  These five villages, whose outlines form the shape of a plum flower, surround Butterfly Hill, creating a sunken terrace – the plum shape and the sunken terrace, whose Chinese characters are romanised as ‘Mui’ and ‘Wo’ respectively, gave Mui Wo its name.  Begin your hike by following the carriageway at the pier all the way up to the barbecue site at the top of Nam Shan Au in the Lantau South Country Park.  The footpath is lined with Taiwan acacia giving some welcome shade from the sun, making the hike even easier.    For hiking enthusiasts, this section cannot be any easier, but anyone intending to finish the entire Lantau Trail would be well-advised to adequately equip themselves beforehand and refuel at the pavilion in Nam Shan Au."
T40,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 2) Nam Shan to Pak Kung Au,Lantau,4,3,5,4,6.5,2.75,"Adorned with a seemingly limitless sea of silvergrass at an elevation of 869 metres and 749 metres respectively, Sunset Peak and Yi Tung Shan have not only been a paradise for hiking enthusiasts, but also a magnet for photography aficionados.  You can reach them by walking along the stone steps from the barbecue site at Nam Shan Au, the start point of Section Two of the Lantau Trail.  In Autumn, you can see the 20 stone chalets of the Lantau Mountain Camp stand among the silvergrass.  The stone sheds, each standing around three metres, were made of granite transported manually from Mui Wo.  They served as a place for spiritual formation and holiday accommodation for British missionaries in the 20th century, and are now vacation rentals for foreigners as well as a popular check-in location.  Follow the stone steps leading down from Sunset Peak to Pak Kung Au.  On the way you can look at Hong Kong’s longest beach, Cheung Sha Beach, which spans three kilometres.  Section Two is not as easy as it looks; it is best defined by its steeply undulating terrain, so hikers intending to complete it should keep an eye on their fitness level."
T41,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 3) Pak Kung Au to Ngong Ping,Lantau,4,3,5,4,4.5,2.25,"Before Hong Kong became a city and port, Lantau Peak had always been referred to as ‘Lan Tau’, which is the romanisation of the words ‘broken head’ in Chinese, by local villagers because the outline of its summit looks broken apart.  In the 19th century when British people came to Hong Kong, the whole island was called the same name; this is how Lantau Island got its name.  The third section of the Lantau Trail, which was also named after Lantau Peak, begins uphill from Pak Kung Au to Lantau Peak.  ‘Pak Kung’, which is also known as God of the Soil and the Ground, is a tutelary deity worshiped by Chinese communities for protection.  From an altitude of some three hundred metres to 934 metres, the path is mostly paved with stone steps.  Like the previous section, this section is not as strenuous a climb as one would imagine, as long as hikers pace themselves and settle into their own rhythm.  Towering into the sky, Lantau Peak is often cloaked in a shroud of mist – you would think you were stepping into a fairyland.  The footpath is also embellished with the  pink-petalled Westland’s Rhododendron that are exceptionally easy on the eye.  On any sunny day in early summer, you will be afforded views of the azure sky and verdant woodlands in high resolution.  At the top of Lantau Island, there is a steep rock staircase dubbed ‘Staircase to the Sky’ leading you down to Ngong Ping Village, a good place to explore and have a break.  For each step you take on the staircase, you can feel the arduous work involved in building the rock steps."
T42,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 4) Ngong Ping to Sham Wat Road,Lantau,2,3,3,3,4,1.25,"Section 4 begins at Ngong Ping, where the Wisdom Path, a landscaped installation of 38 massive wooden pillars arranged in the pattern of the infinity symbol, is seen not far away.  The wooden columns, inscribed with the original calligraphy featuring the Heart Sutra from world-renowned sinologist Professor Jao Tsung-I, are infused with religious elements and blended perfectly with the rural surroundings.  The footpath then joins Nei Lak Shan Country Trail and Ngong Ping Road, along which you can see the mountain range of Lantau Peak on your side.  Walk past the north side of Shek Pik Reservoir and be impressed by the placid blue waters of the reservoir.  Now a two-way road runs across the top of the dam, but prior to the completion of the reservoir in 1963, the site was inhabited by several villages, including Shek Pik Wai, Fan Pui Tsuen, Kong Pui Tsuen, Sha Tsui Tsuen, Chung Hau Tsuen, and Hang Tsai Tsuen, of which villagers used to farm somewhere down the reservoir.  Because of the construction of the reservoir, they were relocated to Tsuen Wan, Mui Wo, and Tai Long Wan, which is near Shek Pik.  Running both in woodland and beside vehicular roads, this section leads down gently and steadily – its level of difficulty is between the previous section and the next.  It definitely is a hike to enjoy."
T43,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 5) Sham Wat Road to Man Cheung Po,Lantau,3,3,2,4,7.5,2.75,"Start your hike at the trail behind the pavilion at the junction of Sham Wat Road and Keung Shan Road.  Follow the signs and pay a visit to ‘Knee-cap Peak’(Kwun Yam Shan), whose outline resembles the shape of a knee for a sweeping panoramic view of the Shek Pik Reservoir.  Deep in the woodland of Kwun Yam Shan stands the ancient Kwun Yam Temple, which was built in the 2nd year of Xuantong, 1910.  It is a temple that will surely catch your eyes – its exterior walls are painted in vermilion and its dome golden.  In fact, it attracts crowds of worshippers and tourists every year.  Descend from Kwun Yam Shan to Keung Shan at 459 metres, which links Ling Wui Shan to the west.  The 3.5-kilometre Ling Wui Shan stretches from the north east to the south west across five peaks, separating Tai Long Wan and Yi O.  Head westwards from the main summit of Keung Shan along the Lantau Trail, where the terrain is flat and fertile, a large scraps of green lawns is found.  Walking past the grassland, you will reach the Keung Shan Country Trail, which leads to Man Cheung Po Campsite.  Relax as you admire the breathtaking sight of waterfalls cascading down the mountainside and the beautiful sound of birds chirping in the woods."
T44,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 6)  Man Cheung Po to Tai O,Lantau,2,3,3,3,2.5,1,"Hailed as the Venice of Hong Kong, Tai O is a fishing port situated at the Pearl River Estuary.  According to the inscriptions in Kwan Tai Temple, many years ago there used to be three types of fishing vessels, namely trawlers, gillnetters, and longliners.  As the once thriving fishing industry shrinks, together with fast-flowing boat traffic because of the criss-crossing waterways and convenient accommodation thanks to the opening of the Tai O Heritage Hotel, Tai O has become a magnet for the likes of tourists, hikers, and photographers in recent years.  Access to Tai O, which is surrounded by mountains and waters as well as stilt houses, is easy with vehicular and ferry access, but the roads through the mountains are another route to consider.  Section Six of the Lantau Trail starts at Lung Tsai Ng Yuen.  Follow the signs for a while and you will soon reach a pavilion called “Nan Yam Ting”, which commands the view of an ancient stone path stretching from there to Man Cheung Po.  As you continue walking downhill, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Tai O – Tin Lee Court, Yim Tin Playground, the ferry pier, and even the stilt houses near Sun Ki Bridge come into view.  Soon you will reach Nam Chung Village, where there are several small houses constructed with green bricks.  You can also navigate and explore the streets of Tai O, which will be quite an experience."
T45,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 7) Tai O to Kau Ling Chung,Lantau,3,3,3,2,10.5,3,"The longest of all of the Lantau Trail, this section begins at Nam Chung Village after leading out of the mountains of the Lantau Country Parks.  As it passes through the most southwesterly waters of Hong Kong, it marks the second half of the Lantau Trail.  This part is not to be missed by any ocean enthusiasts, as the footpath is flat and traverses a shingle beach and a mangrove forest.  Not far away, you can get a view of the Pearl River Estuary, where the river enters the Pacific Ocean.  With fresh and salt water, it has become a habitat for Chinese white dolphins.  The names of the two places ahead are appetising enough to make your mouth water – Tsin Yue Wan Campsite and Kai Yet Kok, also called Peaked Hill, which literally mean ‘fried fish bay campsite’ and ‘chicken wings corner’ respectively.  The former is located at the westernmost point of Hong Kong; the latter, situated close to the shore, is an island that got its name for its chicken-wing-like shape – it protrudes from the south and curves inwards from the northern part.  Continue and soon you will see the estuarine mixing zone between the river and the ocean.  The waters, clear on one side and murky on the other, form a natural boundary, which is an incredible sight."
T46,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 8) Kau Ling Chung to Shek Pik,Lantau,2,3,1,2,5.5,1.5,"The picturesque Kau Ling Chung Campsite marks the start point of this section.  Kau Ling Chung features a viewing point up on a hilltop at the east overlooking the most southwesterly waters of Hong Kong and the century-old South Lantau Obelisk, which, as the counterpart of the North Lantau Obelisk in Tai O, indicates the southernmost part of the New Territories ceded by the Qing government.  As you head for Shek Pik Reservoir along the coast, you can catch glimpses of Soko Islands.  If you opt for the route near Tai Long Wan during rainy seasons, chances are you can get a view of the waterfall overflowing into the bay.  Near the footpath that passes through Tai Long Wan Village, there lies Shek Pik Hung Hau Ancient Temple, where Hung Shing Ye and Hau Wong Yeung Leung-jit,(Not sure spelling) who helped the last Emperor of the Southern Sung Dynasty to flee to Lantau Island and Kowloon City, are worshipped by locals.  Traversing three campsites, picnic facilities, and a number of bays within a short distance, Section Eight is ideal for picnickers."
T47,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 9) Shek Pik to Shui Hau,Lantau,2,3,1,1,6.5,2,"The local countryside is defined by a mixture of half artificially built and the other half naturally occurring reservoirs. As the main source of fresh water supply, they can be found along many footpaths. Section Nine starts at the dam of Shek Pik Reservoir. Completed in 1963, the reservoir has the third largest storage capacity after High Island Reservoir and Plover Cove Reservoir, and is surrounded by mountains – Kau Nga Ling in the east, Muk Yue Shan and Sze Tse Tau Shan north, and Keung Shan west. It submerges the valley, which used to be inhabited by villagers of Shek Pik Tai Tseun, Fan Pui Tsuen, Kong Pui Tsuen, and Hang Tsai Tseun. In the east of the dam stands an observation platform, which commands sweeping views of the reservoir, its flood-relief channel with a 24-metre diameter, and the summits. Since it is located on the right side of the flat road that leads from the main dam to Tai O, it is easily accessible to drivers. The 3000-year-old Shek Pik Rock Carving is in the vicinity, witnessing human evolution and coastal development for three millennia. To the south of the coast are the most southwesterly group of islands in Hong Kong, Soko Islands, which consist of more than ten islands of different sizes, including A Chau, Siu A Chau, Ma Chau, and Yuen Chau. Since archaeological traces that date back to the Stone Age were discovered in these far-off islands, one cannot help but wonder whether inhabitants in the prehistoric period also enjoyed the very same scenery."
T48,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 10) Shui Hau to Old Tung Chung Road,Lantau,2,3,1,1,6.5,2,"If you are like any city dwellers who always want a weekend getaway from the concrete jungle, then Section Ten is the place.  Number of bays could be seen, this section, full of holiday-makers at weekends, begins at Shui Hau Village, which was once a large village on Lantau Island.  The village is an ideal place for families to get close to nature – it is home to farms that produce such fruit as lychees and papayas; it has a long mudflat of high biodiversity because of the slow-flowing water from the natural sea bay facing the village.  In particular, when the tide retreats, horseshoe crabs can be spotted and the sky is reflected off the water surface of the mudflat, forming ‘the mirror of the sky’.  The second half of the section features some beautiful beaches in Tong Fuk and Cheung Sha, where a lot of pottery and stoneware were once unearthed.  It is said that the area has been inhabited by people since the Ming Dynasty for its bumper fish harvest.  You can also drop by Tin Hau Temples and Kwan Tai Temples of different sizes along the village and the coast."
T49,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 11) Tung Chung Road to Pui O,Lantau,2,1,1,2,4.5,1.25,"As the easiest section of the Lantau Trail, Section 11 begins at a vehicular road that leads to the shaded footpath. Beyond the shaded path is a wide view of the bay, with Chi Ma Wan Peninsula and Shek Kwu Chau in the distance and Pui O Beach in the vicinity.  Pui O, formerly referred to as Lo Pui O because the shape of its terrain resembles that of a conch, is one of the most popular local beaches, with clear turquoise water and soft pale sand.  It is also a site of archeological interest, as neolithic artefacts, which bear testimony to ancient settlement, were once found there.  This is actually echoed by “Yue Daji”, which keeps a record of events that took place in Guandong in the Ming dynasty.  In addition to vacation rentals, a range of facilities are also available near Pui O Beach, including campsites, and barbecue pits.  You will definitely want to spend the day in this short yet fulfilling footpath."
T50,P15,Lantau Trail (Section 12) Pui O to Mui Wo,Lantau,3,3,3,2,9,3,"The end of the trip to the seaside between Section 7 and Section 11 marks the beginning of the last leg of the Lantau Trail.  It takes you through the jungle and up the mountain to admire the beauty of the bay of Lantau Island from another angle ― Pui O Wan, which is filled with never-ending streams of holiday-makers, on the west and the tranquil Chi Ma Wan on the east, encircling and isolating Shap Long San Tsuen – a striking contrast to the cityscape of Hong Kong Island on the horizon.  Although the farm has been desolate for a long time, the buffalos that return to the wild remind people of the idyllic setting in days gone by.  The final part leads down the slope to the heart of Mui Wo, which is easily accessible by public transport. Throughout history, Mui Wo has undergone tremendous changes – as early as the Ming Dynasty, it was already settled by farmers, followed by a period of mining in the nearby Silver Mine Bay; in the 1930s, it gradually developed into a resort town that still bustles with life as people come for the seafood at weekends.  Yet there is one thing that never changes – the hiking trail makes for memorable and relaxing experience."
T51,P01,Lau Shui Heung Country Trail,North New Territories,3,2,3,3,4.4,2,"Lau Shui Heung, a feast for the eyes and ears, certainly lives up to its name.  The start point Lau Shui Heung Reservoir, which is called ‘the Mirror of the Sky in the Forest’ among hikers, is a fairyland – in the morning it is cloaked in mist; on windless days upright Paperbark trees lined on the opposite shore are reflected in the water, with Lung Shan Bridge in the vicinity.  Built after the Second World War, this reservoir used to feed neighbouring farmland, but is now a hot spot for picnicking and taking photos at weekends.  This country trail is a circular trail, beginning and ending at the reservoir.  Despite some steep ascents in the latter part, the trail offers some recreational facilities like pavilions and barbecue sites, which makes the trip less difficult to complete.  To its northwest sits Kat Tsai Shan Au, which used to be filled with the pleasant scent of mandarin oranges given off by the rich crop of mandarin oranges prior to the Second World War.  The latter leg of the trail is Lung Shan, where a terraced campsite is located.  Word has it that before being renamed for auspicious reasons, Lung Shan was formerly known as Cheuk Shan."
T52,P07,Lo Fu Tau Country Trail,Lantau,2,2,3,3,3.4,1.25,"Literally translated as ‘Get rid of fleas on a tiger’s head’, the Cantonese saying means to provoke somebody cruel or powerful.  Hikers that opt for Lo Fu Tau Country Trail totally take the bull by the horns despite challenges of getting to the top of the mountain.  Located in Lantau North Country Park, the trail starts at A Po Long, which can be reached by following Pak Ngan Heung or Pak Mong Village for an hour.  After the starting point, the route gets exposed and hikers would need to climb up the slope that is 3 kilometres long.  Therefore, visitors are advised to have themselves properly protected from the sun and hydrated on hot and sunny days, but look on the bright side – scanty vegetation means the path does not fail to stun hikers with broad views.  Groups of huge stones, varying in shapes, can be spotted.  Some look like being cut by tools with sharp edges, and thus gain the name “Sword Testing Stone” among hiking lovers; another group of stones look like a springboard in a swimming pool or a protruding beak and therefore, they are known as “Strange Duck Stone”; another rock, resembling a peach, is called “Peach Stone”.  No wonder some compare this place to Zhuge Liang’s Octagonal Battle Plot.  Beyond these strange looking rocks, the ending point of the path, could be seen along the side facing the sea, overlooking Discovery Bay, Nim Shue Wan, with Peng Chau and Hong Kong Disneyland, which is situated at Chok Ko Wan Tsui, in the distance.  In autumn, the grassland turns gold and the hillside looks even more like the skin of tigers, creating the picture of hikers climbing up the back of a tiger.  Whether hikers want to become “fleas” is of their own choice."
T53,P12,Luk Wu Country Trail,Sai Kung,3,3,3,3,4.7,3,"It is not uncommon to think of trails near the water during summer. Along Luk Wu Country Trail, hiking enthusiasts can enjoy extensive views of High Island Reservoir on the south and Tai Long Wan on the east. Also, they can have the chance to walk past Sheung Luk Stream, which is hailed as one of the nine famous streams locally and offers their eyes a cool break.  Setting off from Sai Wan Road in Sai Kung, visitors are welcomed by High Island Reservoir, which boasts the greatest capacity among all reservoirs in Hong Kong.  The reservoir kept the name of a fishing village that was affected and further relocated due to the reservoir construction projects. In February, Chinese New Year Flowers greet hikers along the route, which leads to the picturesque Sheung Luk Stream through the thick woods. Along the path, there are countless stone walls that were once part of Luk Wu Village.  Due to its remote location, the place displays tranquility and quite a lot of monks and votaries clean their minds there though most of the religious sites are no longer operating now.   There are a few ascents which require certain physical strength but hikers will get rewarded by scenes of Chek Keng Hau, Sham Wan Tsai, Wan Tsai Peninsula and Tap Mun.  Visitors will also find a unique sign marking “one and only” and depicting a deer’s head, which serves as a photo-taking spot."
T54,P20,Lung Ha Wan Country Trail,Sai Kung,2,3,3,3,2.3,1,"Lung Ha Wan Country Trail is well equipped with recreational facilities such as a barbecue site and a refreshment kiosk at the start point Tai Hang Tun Park as well as a kite-flying site not far from the entrance.  With a lot to offer, the route is easy to plan and very suitable for citizens with a hectic urban life and hiking beginners who want a half-day getaway trip.  Lying along the east coast of Clear Water Bay Country Park, which sticks out into the sea, the 2-kilometre Lung Ha Wan Country Trail brings magnificent vistas of mountains and oceans together and it is not physically demanding.  Passing the series of stone stairs at the start of the trail, you will be amazed by the exceptionally broad views on the rounded summit of Tai Leng Tung – it commands a bird-eye view of, from north to south, bays such as Port Shelter and Clear Water Bay, and a superb panorama of Po Toi O, a natural haven looking like a sack, Shelter Island, Jin Island, Basalt Island, and as far south east as the Ninepin Group.  When you finish the route, not far from the finishing point, you will come across the Lung Ha Wan Rock Carving at the cliff.  The rock carving, with patterns of birds and geometry and approximately 3,000 years of history, was discovered by tourists in 1978."
T55,P03,Lung Mun Country Trail,West New Territories,3,2,2,3,5,2.5,"Every hike at Lung Mun Country Trail starts with ""eating"", as Yum Cha in the morning in Chuen Lung has been seen as ‘the launching ceremony’ here.  Situated around the mid slope of Tai Mo Shan, this Hakka village was originally populated by villagers of Longchuan County in Guangdong, who migrated south to Tsuen Wan in the early 15th century.  It is said that villagers called ‘Tai Mo Shan’ as such to commemorate a mountain of the same name in Longchuan County.  Leaving the Hakka village for the shady and primitive trail, hikers will pass three streams with cool running water, including Tai Yuen Stream, where there is an abundance of water, soothing hikers under the hot and blazing sun. After a distance of smooth trail, hikers will be welcomed with urban views of Tsuen Wan District, which is surrounded by Kam Shan and Tai Mo Shan, and with the sights of Ting Kau Bridge, which extends to the south west, and two straits that are crossed by Tsing Ma Bridge.  Hikers will arrive at Shing Mun Reservoir after finishing the last bit of downhill road."
T56,P19,Ma On Shan Country Trail,Central New Territories,2,2,3,2,4.5,2,"With rich deposits of magnetite and haematite in the granite of Ma On Shan, mining activities were recorded between 1906 and 1976 and ores can still be found with a magnet today. Back then miners and their families settled around the mine and formed a village, now known as Ma On Shan Village. After being shut down for a very long time, the school and the church in the village have been revitalised and turned into Grace Youth Camp, showcasing the mining history a century ago and allowing public visitors to explore the history of Ma On Shan. The first part of the country trail, although characterised by a series of stone steps that wind up the slopes, is totally worth the trek, as it leads to the grassy plain of Ngong Ping, with a lookout on the hillside overlooking islands stretching from Sai Kung Town to Port Shelter, and High Island Reservoir in Sai Kung East Country Park in the distance. The magnificent sunrise here has attracted many people to Ngong Ping Campsite, where paragliders jump off and fly freely in the valley at weekends. In autumn, hikers may also hike Pyramid Hill, which extends as far south as a stone-built ancient trail through the golden grassland. Along the way, there is a plantation of Taiwan Acacia, which can survive the toughest conditions – it can not only survive on barren land, but also tolerate fire and resprout after fire, making it an ideal firebreak to prevent the spread of hill fire."
T57,P19,Ma On Shan Family Walk,Central New Territories,1,3,1,2,0.44,0.25,"Ma On Shan Family Walk is located on the hillside of Ma On Shan, Hong Kong’s fourth tallest peak at an elevation of 702 metres. The family walk starts and ends inside the large barbecue site, making it an ideal place to have a barbecue, relax and exercise, and get to know of the other side of our city at weekends. The walk has one viewing point that command breathtaking vistas extending from Ma On Shan New Town, which was developed in the 1980s, to Tolo Harbour and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which is located on a mountain as well as views of Ma On Shan Country Park and Shing Mun River in Sha Tin New Town. Other highlights along the trail include Ma On Shan Mine, whose traces still remain in the woodlands, and Grace Youth Camp inside Ma On Shan Village. Formerly Yan Kwong Lutheran Church and a village school complex before the revitalisation project, Grace Youth Camp is a Grade III historical building and allows visitors to explore the mining times a century ago."
T58,P18,Ma Shi Chau Nature Trail,North New Territories,1,1,1,1,1.5,1,"Ma Shi Chau Nature Trail is located in the Ma Shi Chau Special Area, fairly close to Yim Tin Tsai. Formed as a result of the deposition of fine particles that gradually turn into sandspits, a tombolo emerges when the tide is below 1.5 metres, connecting Sam Mun Tsai, Tai Po with Ma Shi Chau through Yim Tin Tsai, leading to the entrance of Ma Shi Chau Nature Trail. Further ahead are siltstone in marbled patterns, as well as the combined landforms of mudstone and siltstone. With the rocks formed over 280 million years ago, there are also other geological wonders, including alternate red sedimentary rocks and celadon green tuff. Not only are these natural wonders breathtaking, they are also intriguing to look at, as some of them are strange-looking."
T59,P12,MacLehose Trail (Section 1)Pak Tam Chung to Long Ke,Sai Kung,3,2,2,2,10.6,3,"Many people are envious of the beaches overseas, which are as crystal-clear as glass. Sai Kung, in fact, also has a glassy reservoir awaiting your visit. The section between Pak Tam Chung and Long Ke, albeit quite long, has a gentle slope and is therefore a somewhat comfortable start to a hike. Commanding the best view in this section is unequivocally the clear and blue High Island Reservoir, which was built in 1979, when some 400 Hakka villages had to move out to make way for the reservoir, whose mammoth scale was therefore self-explanatory. Breath-taking scenery, whether natural or manmade, is seen not only in the mountain but also along the seashore - the wooden footpath in the East Dam of High Island Reservoir, a cofferdam of some 7000 dolosse, s-shaped hexagonal rock columns, Po Pin Chau and the like. Upon the completion of this section, either opt to proceed forward or stay in Long Ke Wan Campsite. The coast along Long Ke Wan is known for a unique landscape of rhyolite, which is a kind of small volcanic rock and is formed in the course of the rapid and different cooling rates at the lava surface and bottom layer. You can appreciate the grey-brown hexagonal columns formed by rhyolite, or you can stay behind and revel in the Milky Way in the dark sky against the sound of swells, enjoying the beauty of Hong Kong from a different perspective."
T60,P12,MacLehose Trail (Section 2)Long Ke to Pak Tam Au,Sai Kung,4,3,3,4,13.5,5,"MacLehose Trail Section 2 is one of the phenomenally popular hiking trails, and this is the best section for you to feel the beauty of the coast of Hong Kong.  At the start of MacLehose Trail Section 2 is the steep, 314-metre Sai Wan Shan; only after descending from this mountain can you reach Sai Wan beach, otherwise known as “the Maldives of Hong Kong”. With white clouds in the azure sky and crystal-clear seawater, the hike will be well worth it when you reach Sai Wan.  In the stargazing area in Sai Wan, you can even rest and take photographs by day against the benches resembling staves and piano keys.  Moving on from Tai Long Wan will bring you to Ham Tin Wan, Tai Long Au and then Chek Keng.  Chek Keng Village has over 200 years of history and although not many people are living there now, the pier, shingle beaches and mangroves in the village present to you another type of scenery, which will be fondly etched in your memory."
T61,P10,MacLehose Trail (Section 3)Pak Tam Au to Kei Ling Ha,Sai Kung,4,2,3,4,10.2,4,"Featuring undulating mountains with a steep gradient, the third section of the MacLehose Trail is definitely one of the top three in terms of difficulty. Surrounded by Ngam Tau Shan, Wa Mei Shan, Lui Ta Shek and Kai Kun Shan, their dazzling heights at around 400 metres above sea level can also offer you distinct appearances of the rolling mountains from different angles. Terraced fields can even be seen in the depths of the forest. Climbing from Pak Tam Au, the start point, up to Ngau Yee Shek Shan is a radical challenge of the third section of the MacLehose Trail. Every one of the stone steps, which are about one kilometre long, puts your perseverance through the mill, and if you successfully navigate your way to the crest of the mountain, you will be rewarded with an unobstructed view up there - Kei Ling Ha Hoi to the east, Tolo Harbour to the north, Tai Po to the west, Ma On Shan to the south. After a break on the crest of Cheung Sheung, proceed to Kai Kung Shan, and if you are determined to plough on, rest, food and water are crucial."
T62,P19,MacLehose Trail (Section 4)Kei Ling Ha to Tate's Cairn,Sai Kung,4,3,4,4,12.7,5,"The fourth section of the MacLehose Trail is another gateway to even more breath-taking scenery, as they say “Perfection knows no limits”. Go through Wong Chuk Yeung Village from Shui Long Wo, and then climb up to the 555-metre high Ma On Shan pass. Although by no means an easy section, it commands Yim Tin Tsai and Kau Sai Chau from a height – the higher you are, the further you can see. Upon arrival in Ngong Ping, what immediately comes into view is a vast plateau. When you reach the mountainside of Buffalo Hill, you might even see Machilus trees whose leaves slowly turn red, all over the mountain in spring. The fourth section does not end until you reach Gilwell Campsite after trekking west from Buffalo Hill. Gilwell Campsite is an exclusive and important base of the Scout Association of Hong Kong, concomitantly located in front of it is the well-known “The Great Wall of the MacLehose Trail”. With large stones lying on much of the ground, walking on it is like hiking the Great Wall of China. Conquering the fourth section of the MacLehose Trail is something to take pride in."
T63,P23,MacLehose Trail (Section 5)Tate's Cairn to Tai Po Road,Central New Territories,3,2,3,4,10.6,4.5,"The MacLehose Trail spreads over many mountains, with its fifth section being the closest to the city and a relatively easier section. You might come across a lot of remains of World War II, such as grounds holes and trenches, some of which could be as deep as one metre. These could well be impressive views to local hikers. Trekking from Gilwell Campsite to Tate’s Cairn, you will reach Reunification Pavilion after crossing the ridge and going along Shatin Pass Road down to the Lion Pavilion in Shatin Pass and Unicorn Ridge. The pavilion, which boasts breath-taking views, commands Kowloon East and Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, and even as far as Victoria Harbour and Hong Kong Island East. You might just as well take a picture there to capture the spectacular scenery. Also worth mentioning is a radar station in Beacon Hill, which overlooks Kowloon to the south and Shatin to the north, with the view stretching to the horizon."
T64,P14,MacLehose Trail (Section 6)Tai Po Road to Shing Mun,Central New Territories,2,2,2,2,4.6,1.5,"The sixth section is the shortest and easiest section of the MacLehose Trail.  It is, therefore, quite popular among novice hikers. Leaving from Tai Po Road for Shing Mun Reservoir via Kowloon Reservoir, you will see Macaques roaming in groups on the way. The Macaques we can see now are the descendants of the ones previously introduced in Hong Kong with a view to ensuring the safety of fresh water by having them eat poisonous plants, the strychnos plants. Kowloon Reservoir was built in the 1920s, and the cluster of reservoirs comprises Kowloon Reservoir, Kowloon Byewash Reservoir, Kowloon Reception Reservoir and Shek Lei Pui Reservoir. The main dam, valve house, spillway dam, spillway dam recorder house and another recorder house are all declared monuments in Hong Kong. The magnificent dam and energetic Macaques make this section particularly bubbly compared with other sections. Make your way along Smuggler's Ridge to learn about the history of Battle of Hong Kong from Shing Mun Redoubt, Shaftesbury Avenue, and Regent Street and overlook Tsuen Wan and Kwai Chung there, which are bustling with life, prompting us to not only appreciate the value of the local hiking trails but also treasure their proximity to the city."
T65,P16,MacLehose Trail (Section 7)Shing Mun to Lead Mine Pass,Central New Territories,3,2,4,4,6.2,2.5,"Shing Mun Reservoir was built in 1937. Its main dam, steel bridge, valve tower and bellmouth overflow have been graded as Grade I historic buildings, making the reservoir one of the most popular hiking spots among Hongkongers. Over one hundred types of butterflies were recorded within the country park; the paperbark trees that surround the reservoir are even favourite check-in spots. The reservoir leads to Needle Hill, which allegedly means a mountain with a pointed crest in the Hakka dialect.  Despite only having the altitude of 532 metres, Needle Hill, as shown by its name in the Hakka dialect, is exceedingly steep. As a Chinese saying goes, “You would never appreciate the pain if you did not go through it”. Only when you experience it could you understand the experience per se. To scale Needle Hill, you have to climb over a thousand steps within 1.7 kilometres, which, together with sparse trees, puts endurance and willpower through the mill. However, the scenery that one can see on Needle Hill is well worth the efforts. After climbing up to the crest, you will be rewarded with the panoramic view of Shatin in front of you and, if you navigate your way through the narrow and mighty reservoir, you will then be rewarded with the view of Kwai Chung, Tsing Yi and Tseun Wan. If you scale Grassy Hill, which has an altitude of 647 metres, you can enjoy an even wider view ― this is what the hikers call Needle Hill, Grassy Hill and Tai Mo Shan face one another. Never will you get bored with the spectacular views on the way to the end point ― Lead Mine Pass."
T66,P03,MacLehose Trail (Section 8) Lead Mine Pass to Route Twisk,Central New Territories,4,3,5,3,9.7,4,"Hong Kong used to have many mine sites, one of which was Lead Mine Pass. There were mining activities in the east of Shing Mun Country Park in as early as the 1930s. It was not until the 1960s that the mine sites were derelict, even to date, as a result of the emergence of a large number of overseas large-scale mine sites and the plummeting price of ore. Lead Mine Pass still has many mine caves which owns a history of over a century. Don’t be daunted by the 600 upward steps starting from Lead Mine Pass, the remaining tracks of the eighth section are flat and easy to walk. Tai Mo Shan, with the height of 957 meters, which you will walk past on the way, is the highest mountain in Hong Kong. It is also the start point of Shing Mun River and Lam Tsuen River. The hillside in the north are wet and cold, which laid the foundations for the growth of camellia. Remains of trapezoid-shaped tea cultivation fields, which were established in the past, can still be seen. In autumn, countless hikers gravitate towards Tai Mo Shan to take pictures of the golden miscanthus. Cattle are every so often seen to prop themselves against each other to take rests. Enjoying the scenery from a height is always the reward for hiking. On sunny days with a cloudless sky, you can not only enjoy the view of the New Territories from Tai Mo Shan but also Tsing Ma Bridge and Shenzhen. On humid days, the mist-enveloped city is yet another sort of scenery shrouded in mystery."
T67,P03,MacLehose Trail (Section 9)Route Twisk to Tin Fu Tsai,West New Territories,2,1,3,1,6.3,2.5,"There is an observation deck soon after the trail starts. The south of the observation deck overlooks Tsuen Wan and Stonecutters Bridge, while the north of it commands Ho Pui Irrigation Reservoir, which is encircled by forests. A small island in the middle of the calm water, Ho Pui Reservoir is the source of water for irrigation for the farmers in northwest New Territories. At the foot of the mountain is the scenery of the rural plains of Pat Heung, Shek Kong and Kam Tin. If you look closely, you will even see a mine cave at the roadside that is no longer used. With trees lining the trail, even summer is not stifling.  Spring brings yet another type of scenery - the blooming native Red Azalea will add redness to the mountain. Don’t forget the bluish and purplish flower, known as Skullcap, which may be right next to your foot though. A military general of the Han dynasty, Han Xin, allegedly used Skullcap to treat the soldiers. On the way, you will see Snake Strawberries, whose receptacles swell like balls and which look like strawberries. You will also see a type of plant called Dichrocephala integrifolia, its flower resembles eyeballs of goldfish."
T68,P03,MacLehose Trail (Section 10)Tin Fu Tsai to Tuen Mun,West New Territories,4,3,3,2,15.6,5,"The last section MacLehose Trail is the lengthiest one, crossing almost half of Tai Lam Country Park and extending to Tuen Mun Town. Kat Hing Bridge is the intersection of streams and was the main access connecting Yuen Long to Tsuen Wan. There used to be seven small crossing bridges, which the residents called “Tsat To Ho”. It was not until 1868 that the people living there pitched in and built Kat Hing Bridge, which was revamped in the 1950s when Tai Lam Chung Reservoir was constructed. In the vicinity of distance post M173, you will walk through a small crossing bridge, where the damselfly, Indochinese Copperwing, can even be seen. Along the north side of Tai Lam Chung Reservoir, constructed in 1957, the reservoir was the first reservoir in Hong Kong after World War II. The 45-metre high main dam crosses Tai Lam Chung Valley and is the largest of the New Territories valley reservoirs. Since the valley where the reservoir is located is a hill belt, many islands were formed after water is stored, hence the green “Thousand-Island Lake of Hong Kong” of today."
T69,P19,Nai Chung Tree Walk,Central New Territories,1,2,1,1,0.27,0.2,"Nai Chung Tree Walk is located in the Nai Chung Barbecue Site of Ma On Shan Country Park. Despite a length of only 270m, you can learn more about trees while strolling along the Tree Walk. The Tree Walk features 20 common tree species, enabling you to appreciate and learn about various species of trees such as Big-leaved Acacia, Taiwan Acacia and Paper-bark Tree. You can also understand more about AFCD’s early plantation schemes in country parks, as well as how to enhance biodiversity in country parks through increase planting of native trees."
T70,P01,Nam Chung Country Trail,North New Territories,3,4,4,4,5.5,2.5,"Situated close to the north eastern border, Nam Chung does not have precipitous cliffs or dangerous streams, but what it does have among the abandoned fishponds and fields is the nostalgic scenery of rural Hong Kong, with natural landscape of mangroves, freshwater marshes, etc.  Not only does it offer scenic splendours of mountains and water, it is also home to a wealth of wildlife because of the surrounding mangroves, freshwater marshes and fishponds.  In particular, the nearby Sha Tau Kok Hoi has become a paradise for egrets and herons, which can be easily spotted between March and August.  The hiking trail passes through Ping Nam Stream, where different species of dragonflies can be found.  Beyond Kwai Tau Leng, you can find Tan Chuk Hang and San Uk Tsai Village.  The fields, ditches, lotus ponds, orchards, and marshes scattered in Tan Chuk Hang make for wonderful spots to watch butterflies and dragonflies.  Wildlife and a small number of villages enjoy a harmonious coexistence on these freshwater wetlands."

T72,P15,Nei Lak Shan Country Trail,Lantau,2,4,1,2,5,2,"Nei Lak Shan Country Trail, a level circular path, starts at the entrance of Dong Shan Fa Mun.  In contrast with the breathtaking Lantau Peak, the flat trail, is just like a path surrounding the tummy of Maitreya Buddha.  Along the trail there are lookouts overlooking Ngong Ping and the Big Buddha.  In spring and summer, the sights are complemented by fog and mist while in autumn and winter, the picture is supplemented with swaying silvergrass.  The middle part of the route overlaps a cable car line, providing visitors with the interesting scene of cable cars passing above their heads.  In the evening, the views of Ngong Ping Village and the Big Buddha are enhanced by the sunset in the background.  The trail passes through a number of secondary forests, which have a rich diversity of plants such as Buttercup Orchids with yellow flowers and Hong Kong Burmannia.  Scenes vary along the route – on the east it looks out on Tung Chung Town Centre and the monasteries and temples scattered on the hill, while on the north, it overlooks the figure-like airport and Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which stretches into the Peal River."
T73,P15,Ngong Ping Trail (Lantau Peak Section),Lantau,4,3,4,5,5.2,4,"Ngong Ping Trail (Lantau Peak Section) starts at Ngong Ping Nature Centre. After walking pass the old tea garden, where the Wisdom Path, a landscaped installation of 38 massive wooden pillars arranged in the pattern of the infinity symbol, is seen not far away. The wooden columns, inscribed with the original calligraphy featuring the Heart Sutra from world-renowned sinologist Professor Jao Tsung-I, are infused with religious elements and blended perfectly with the rural surroundings. Passing through the Lantau Peak archway, the challenge to reach the top of Lantau Peak at 934 m in height starts. Before Hong Kong became a city and port, Lantau Peak had always been referred to as ‘Lan Tau’, which is the romanisation of the words ‘broken head’ in Chinese, by local villagers because the outline of its summit looks broken apart. In the 19th century when British people came to Hong Kong, the whole island was called the same name; this is how Lantau Island got its name. Climbing up a steep rock staircase dubbed ‘Staircase to the Sky’ to Lantau Peak is not as strenuous a climb as one would imagine, as long as hikers pace themselves and settle into their own rhythm. On any sunny day in early summer, you will be afforded views of the azure sky and verdant woodlands in high resolution."

The entire route takes less than an hour and features high plant diversity. For example, overhead are the commonly seen species Taiwan Acacia and Ear-leaved Acacia. The former produces pompon-like golden blossoms from March to October while the latter bears spikes of yellow flowers from September to November. On the ground are some ferns and shrubs, as well as some dense stands of bamboos and climbers. Beyond the former Hakka village houses and the abandoned orchards is the finishing point of the trail."

At low tide, fiddler crabs and mudskippers appear on the mud surface of mangroves. Plants like Longans, Night-blooming Cereus, and Sandpaper Vine, which were used for cleaning pots in the old days, are seen by the sides. At the finishing point of the level trail is Sheung Yiu Folk Museum, which introduces the history of Sheung Yiu Village. Built in the late 19th century, Sheung Yiu Village was inhabited by Hakka villagers who lived on producing bricks and tiles by burning lime. With the advent of the cement industry, cement took the place of lime, causing the villagers to move away to urban areas to earn a living. In the 1960s, the entire village was abandoned until 1984, when the village was opened as Sheung Yiu Folk Museum to display Sheung Yiu Village and the lime kiln, both of which are now declared monuments, for public viewing."

It was once part of Fa Shan, but was cut away from it because of years of wave impact, giving the flank of Po Pin Chau a row of sea stacks that look as if they were cut with a knife with a serrated blade. Don’t miss out on the wooden bridge at the east dam, which allows you to take a close look at the sea cave. Yet what steals the limelight is Biu Tsim Kok, a semi-circular cape on the north side of the East Dam. The hexagonal rock columns surrounding it give the geological landform a picturesque beauty, making it a popular social media check-in spot among hikers. Biu Tsim Kok overlooks the entire East Dam and looks out on Long Ke Wan and Tsang Pang Kok Tsui in the distance.

T86,P25,Pinewood Battery Heritage Trail,Hong Kong Island,1,2,1,1,0.38,0.5,"Located inside Lung Fu Shan Country Park, the Pinewood Battery Heritage Trail features some batteries that have been standing for as many as a hundred years within a span of 400 metres. Before the outbreak of World War I, the British military authorities already intended to build a battery on a hill in the north-western part of Hong Kong Island to strengthen the defence and protect against invasion by France and Russia from the west.  In 1901, the construction of the battery completed on Lung Fu Shan at an elevation of 307 metres, overlooking the entire western district on Hong Kong Island and enjoying the best terrain advantage.  With the advent of air power following the First World War, the battery was converted into an anti-aircraft battery, with the addition of many battery buildings and bunkers around in order to defend against the Japanese army.  Not only has it stood witness to the local military development, it has also seen the Battle of Hong Kong.   In the December of 1941, it was air-raided and the anti-aircraft guns were destroyed, forcing the defending troops to retreat.  Its ruins can still be seen today.  Although the battery itself has long been removed, the original emplacements, bunkers, command post, magazines, observation posts, washrooms, and the many battery buildings generally survive intact and thus are easily identifiable. Overlooking the western part of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbour, this trail has some interpretation panels that remind visitors of the bitter past of the Battle of Hong Kong."
T87,P22,Ping Chau Country Trail,North New Territories,2,3,1,2,6,3,"Situated at the northeasternmost side of Hong Kong, Ping Chau is composed of sedimentary rocks.  The island generously showcases the ancient skeleton of the Earth in a way that it serves like a geological museum.  Enclosing the island of Tung Ping Chau and occupying a sea area of 270 hectares, Tung Ping Chau Marine Park is home to the most diverse species of coral communities locally.  Skirting along Ping Chau, Ping Chau Country Trail features a multitude of landform wonders such as Kang Lau Shek, which stands bold and still on the east seashore and two gigantic sea stacks that are 7-8 metres tall.  Kang Lau Shek, together with the two sea stacks, looks like a look-out that was built for protecting the island long ago.  A closer look at the stacks will reveal their shale lamination.  On the southernmost side are wave-cut platforms that are extended from the cliffs.  These platforms are named so because the area is not accessible at high tide.  Not far away lies a 100-metre sedimentary rock emerging from the sea.  It is called Lung Lok Shui because its spiky edges caused by erosion resemble the back of a dragon.  Towards the end of the route is Cham Keng Chau, which broke off because of years of wave erosion. Attentive observers will notice the walls of villages on the island are built of shale formed millions of years ago."
T88,P21,Plover Cove Reservoir Country Trail,North New Territories,5,2,3,5,15.5,7,"Completed in 1968, Plover Cove Reservoir is the second largest reservoir in Hong Kong in terms of the area it covers.  The many undulating slopes and the lack of supplies on this long hiking trail that skirts along the lake make it a test of experience and fitness.  Beginning along the ridge, the trail passes through such peaks as Ma Tau Fung, Chek Ma Tau, and Tai Tung.  The small plateau that links Wang Leng Au with Tai Tung is called Sam Toi Teng, which can lead the less physically-strong hikers to Ha Miu Tin to retrace their steps.  In fact, the ridge offers different sorts of scenery – on one side are the rich greenery of Plover Cove Country Park and the estuary of Sam A Wan; on the other side is the full view of Plover Cove Reservoir.  The latter part commands the view of Tolo Channel and leads to the auxiliary dam and the two-kilometre main dam.  As the world’s first reservoir in the ocean, Plover Cove Reservoir is undoubtedly an era-defining representation of creativity and courage – it is formed by connecting the island with land by the damming sections to dam the inlet, and pumping out the sea water and filling it with fresh water.  Along the way, hikers might be able to spot egrets and herons sitting on the floating solar power system, which is yet another social media check-in spot."

Construction of the reservoir was completed in 1863 and the second and larger Pok Fu Lam Reservoir was built upstream from the original reservoir in 1871 in order to solve the water shortage at that time. The former watchman’s cottage, the gauge basin, and the four masonry bridges built of granite are all declared monuments. Beyond the reservoir into the woodlands are many bridges arching over running streams. The abundant water supply and the tall trees provide a habitat for a myriad of birds and insects, with both faint and clear tweeting of birds."
T90,P26,Pok Fu Lam Tree Walk,Hong Kong Island,1,4,1,1,3.2,1,"Pok Fu Lam Tree Walk is the first Hong Kong tree walk featuring native plant species. This route winds along Lugard Road by the Peak Galleria. While admiring the beauty of nature, you also take in superb vistas of Victoria Harbour and the urban districts on both sides. The entrance of Pok Fu Lam Tree Walk shares the same starting point of Stage 1 of Hong Kong Trail. Despite its vicinity to the hot tourist spot, the Tree Walk offers escape from the hustle and bustle of the city, allowing you to feel the peaceful and pleasant ambience of nature. With support of good ecological environment, you will find several interesting plants such as Lance-leaved Sterculia with orange-red star-like fruits, and Reevesia with fruits looking like starfruit along the trail. At the end of the Tree Walk, you can continue your journey from Lugard Road to Harlech Road for a visit to Lung Fu Shan Country Park where military relics such as Pinewood Battery and remains of old forts are preserved."
T91,P09,Pottinger Peak Country Trail,Hong Kong Island,2,3,1,4,1.9,1.5,"If you are looking for a level route that can be accessed easily, there is no better place than Pottinger Peak Country Trail, whose starting point is very close to the heart of Chai Wan.  Embarking at Ma Tong Au of Shek O, you will be greeted with broad views when you go past the catchment, which looks out on another hiking hotspot Dragon’s Back in the distance.  Extending in a westerly direction to the coastlines and bays of Big Wave Bay and Shek O and ends at Cape D’Aguilar, Dragon’s Back prides itself on being the best place to take in the vistas and charm of the sea that surrounds Hong Kong.  Along the path there are butterflies everywhere and a pavilion where tourists could take a break and enjoy the views of Clear Water Bay, Tung Lung Chau, Chai Wan and Siu Sai Wan.  Back in the old days, Hong Kong was an exporter of timber.  Chai Wan, ringed on three sides by mountains, got its name from its rich production of firewood (which is translated as “Chai” in Chinese), but the original name of the place, Sai Wan, fails to live in the memory of most people.  On the other hand, Siu Sai Wan, located in the eastern part of Chai Wan, was once named as Siu Chai Wan and Chai Wan Tsai, both of which failed to be passed on.  This history of how Chai Wan and Siu Sai Wan got their names has created an interesting contrast.  Beyond the viewing point, the finishing point Cape Collinson Road is 300 metres away.  The whole trip takes almost 2 hours."
T92,P05,Quarry Bay Tree Walk,Hong Kong Island,1,3,1,2,1.1,0.6,"Quarry Bay Tree Walk is a comfortable and peaceful route, connecting Mount Parker Road and Kornhill Garden, it also overlaps with Stage 2 of Wilson Trail and part of the Eastern Nature Trail. Though located in downtown area, it offers escape from the city and delights both the body and mind. The Tree Walk is about 1.1km long, where 19 interpretation plates are installed to introduce trees such as Hong Kong Gordonia and Soft-fruited Ormosia. The location of Quarry Bay Tree Walk was important in wartime, as is shown by the remnants of war such as communal stoves and warehouses found along the walk. A stroll along the Tree Walk brings you knowledge about nature and wartime history."
T93,P03,Rotary Park Nature Trail,West New Territories,1,3,2,1,0.8,1,"The Rotary Park Nature Trail is the perfect place for children to get close to nature. A walk with barbecue sites at the start point, the trail is easily accessible and suitable for families. The lush woodlands along the trail give some welcome shade in summer. Together with the humid environment, it provides a habitat for many insects, including interesting-looking Owlflies, which have long antennae on their heads like dragonflies although they are not classified as dragonflies. Since they are attracted to dark, humid spaces, they can be found in bushes. Insects like Dung Beetles may also be spotted by the sides of the trail with careful observation. In early spring, Chekiang Machilus puts out bright red young leaves, which are pleasant to look at. The viewing point commands vistas on the south, including Steep Island, Lamma Island, Tsing Yi, and as far as the summit of Victoria Peak and Mount Davis on the western part of Hong Kong Island."
T94,P24,Sharp Island Country Trail,Sai Kung,1,2,1,1,2,1.5,"Starting from Kiu Tsui near the centre of the West coast of Sharp Island, the Sharp Island Country Trails runs uphill towards Hak Shan Teng and descends gently into the Finish at the scenic beach of Hap Mun Bay. The Country Trail boasts several stunning coastal views especially at the viewing point. To the East, admire the vast grasslands on Kau Sai Chau and spot the old Sai Kung Hakka village settlements further away on the Island of Yim Tin Tsai. To the West, take in views of the renowned tombolo of Sharp Island that stretches towards the islet of Kiu Tao; on clear days, Clear Water Bay Peninsula and High Junk Peak may also be seen afar. Selfie stands are available at viewing points for hands-free captures of visitors with a majestic natural backdrop."
T95,P24,Sharp Island Geo Trail,Sai Kung,1,4,1,2,0.7,1,"Located in Port Shelter, Sai Kung, Sharp Island is connected with a small island called Kiu Tau by a tombolo, which is accessible when the tide is low. Remember to check the tidal information before crossing the tombolo, which is accessible only when the tidal level is lower than 1.4 metres. Situated at the rim of the crater of a volcano with a radius of 20 kilometres that used to sit in Sai Kung around 140 million years ago, Sharp Island is an ideal place for observing igneous rocks, as it is home to many different types of rocks, such as breccia, which is composed of pyroclastic deposits, rhyolite, which is characterised by lava flow lines, and quartz monzonite, which is formed as a result of the cooling down of rocks intruded by lava leaking into the cracks. Another local special is the pineapple bun. This pineapple bun is in fact quartz monzonite, whose cracked outer layer, caused by weathering, resembles the crumbly crust of the iconic Hong Kong food item. It can be easily found by the seaside of Sharp Island. On Kiu Tau, there are sedimentary rocks and a viewing point that looks out on Port Shelter."
T96,P15,Shek Pik Country Trail,Lantau,3,3,4,3,5.5,2,"The country trail begins at Wisdom Path, Ngong Ping, a landscaped installation of 38 massive wooden pillars inscribed with world-renowned sinologist Professor Jao Tsung-I’s Heart Sutra.  Stepping into it instantly helps you leave the busy city life behind.  The descending slope on the west side of Lantau Peak overlooks the entire Shek Pik Reservoir and the precipitous path of Kau Nga Ling, a branch range of Lantau Peak on the east.  Given its risk, hikers are advised not to go there.  Enlivened by the red and pink Hong Kong Hawthorn and Rhododendron everywhere in spring, the well-shaded path is not far away from the Shek Pik Catchment, a wide catchwater that directs water into the reservoir, thereby reducing the dependence on underground water by residents of outlying islands.  Shek Pik Reservoir, the finishing point,  was completed in 1963, This reservoir is surrounded by Kau Nga Ling, Keung Shan, Muk Yue Shan, and Sze Tse Tau Shan.  It is fed by many streams and therefore has the third largest storage capacity after High Island Reservoir and Plover Cove Reservoir."
T97,P12,Sheung Yiu Country Trail,Sai Kung,2,2,1,2,3.3,1.25,"Merging with Pak Tam Chung Nature Trail, Sheung Yiu Country Trail has its starting point situated near Sheung Yiu Folk Museum, which is reconstructed from a 100-year-old Hakka village, and a lime kiln, which was the site for producing lime from coral skeletons.  Through visiting the museum and lime kiln, hikers will get a grasp of the life of indigenous residents of Sai Kung.  Most of the trail is covered with luxuriant woods and it begins with a precipitous climb.  At some of the corners, hiking lovers will be able to spot islands of different sizes such as Wong Yi Chau, Tai Tau Chau, Kai Chau, Kau Sai Chau, Jin Island, and Tuen Tau Chau scattering across Port Shelter and High Island.  In the direction towards Nam Fung Wan, it also passes through Po Kwu Wan Campsite.  Back in the 1970s and the 1980s, the smuggling of Vietnamese refugees was rampant.  A part of Nam Fung Wan served as a custodial centre for Vietnamese boat people until 1998 and is now Astropark and a water sports centre.  Large herds of cattle could be seen resting and eating on the grassland.  The trail ends at Man Yee Road, where visitors can enjoy the views of the reservoir that holds the greatest amount of water in Hong Kong – High Island Reservoir.  The construction work lasted for 7 years and it was completed in 1971."
T98,P12,Sheung Yiu Family Walk,Sai Kung,1,3,1,2,1.8,1,"Sheung Yiu Family Walk is an attractive place where everything is rolled into one – here visitors can have a barbecue, go on a hike, and learn about natural habitats and Hong Kong folklore. One may take the popular route of entering from Pak Tam Chung Nature Trail, which skirts along the river, before visiting the Sheung Yiu Folk Museum, a Hakka village called Sheung Yiu Village in the 19th century. Inhabited by the Wong clan, the village had a watchtower overlooking the entrance, a row of eight houses, and a lime kiln that produced lime by burning coal mined in the vicinity. Both the village and the lime kiln have been classified as declared monuments, displaying various farming implements and furniture to recreate the atmosphere and environment of the Hakka village. The woods along the tranquil Sheung Yiu Family Walk look out on the rolling hills of Tai Cham Koi on the north in the distance. Other highlights include a bay, mangroves, barbecue sites, and holiday camps, which make weekend trips easy to plan."
T99,P16,Shing Mun Country Park (Paperbark Tree Forest) Accessible Route,Central New Territories,2,5,2,1,3.8,2,"Completed in 1936, Shing Mun Reservoir was named Jubilee Reservoir to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of King George V of the United Kingdom.  Starting at a refreshment kiosk with accessible toilets nearby, this route follows a tree-shaded path and leads up and down.  Along this well-shaded path in spring and summer, you will be greeted by butterflies fluttering around and dancing jovially – the more commonly seen and easily noticeable are Punchinello, which like to flutter around its larval foodplant Maesa perlarius.  You will also catch sight of macaques jumping around along the forest tracks or eating fruit and leaves on trees.  The vegetation in the surroundings is another attraction that will make your eyes glitter with admiration and amazement – the purple corolla of Callicarpa nudiflora, the reflection of the greenery on the opposite shore in the reservoir, and the tall upright paperbark trees beckoning.  Indeed, it is as if you were stepping into a fairyland when strolling along the road between the lines of paperbark trees.  In short, the flora and fauna of the short journey will surely put you at ease."
T100,P16,Shing Mun Reservoir Walk,Central New Territories,3,4,3,2,7.5,3.5,"Shing Mun Reservoir Walk is a loop trail that begins at Pineapple Dam. The trip starts from the Visitor Centre, which tells the story of Shing Mun Country Park, and continues to the Butterfly Garden. Planted with nectar species such as Lantana and Retuse-leaved Crotalaria, the Garden attracts various types of butterflies in all seasons, making it an ideal spot for butterfly photography."
T101,P15,South Lantau Country Trail,Lantau,3,3,3,3,10.3,3,"South Lantau Country Trail begins in Nam Shan and its hillside commands the full vista of the south part of Lantau Island.  The well-shaded and scenic path is a popular destination in summer, with a lot of massive rocks and flowing water from streams and cascades.  Stretching across Lantau Peak and Sunset Peak, the country trail offers hikers a clear view of the two towering mountains from below.  Beyond Tung Chung Road along the southeastern slope is the Tong Fuk Catchwater, which commands a wide panorama of Cheung Sha Beach, Tong Fuk, Cha Kwo Chau, Shek Kwu Chau, and the Soko Islands."
T102,P06,Tai Lam Chung Country Trail,West New Territories,3,3,3,4,5.5,4,"To enjoy the scenic beauty of Yuen Long, the best way is to walk in the mountains.  Tai Lam Chung Country Trail begins at Ma On Kong Warden Post, which is in close vicinity of Tai Lam Tunnel.  Views open up after series of ascending stairs of the 290-metre country trail, offering the scenery of mountains and water of Yuen Long Plain, Kam Tin, Shap Pat Heung, Tin Shui Wai and Tuen Mun.  The trail also amazes hikers with slopes that have been eroded by rainwater.  The real reward comes after scaling several mountains, when it reaches the finishing point Kat Hing Bridge, which was built more than a hundred years ago.  Given the fast-flowing stream of Chat To River, the bridge was built in the Qing Dynasty to make crossing easier.  The bridge was renovated in the 1950s during the construction of Tai Lam Chung Reservoir.  It is an excellent spot to muse on memories of ancient times, appreciate the beautiful scene of how streams merge together, or even revive the happy memories of walking on Tai Lam Chung Country Trail."
T103,P06,Tai Lam Country Park (Tsing Tam Upper Irrigation Reservoir) Accessible Route,West New Territories,2,3,3,1,6.3,3,"It is normal to relate reservoirs only to those which supply drinking water, but indeed there is another type of reservoirs - irrigation reservoirs.  Of all the 8 irrigation reservoirs in Hong Kong, seven are located in the New Territories. Tsing Tam Irrigation Reservoir is one of them. Providing farmers with irrigation water supply, Tsing Tam Upper and Lower Irrigation Reservoirs are located in the valley behind Tsing Tam Village, Yuen Long, and can be reached by following the flat forest track after getting off at Lui Kung Tin bus station on Route Twisk. After passing through the sitting-out area where accessible toilets are available, the route continues with three uphill sections that are surrounded by increasingly luxuriant trees giving some welcome shade. The forest track itself, usually carpeted with fallen leaves and embellished with white flowers of Tung-oil trees between April and May, is a masterpiece by nature, and the views it offers from afar are equally magnificent - from there you can see Kai Kung Leng, Tai To Yan, Kwun Yam Shan, the stretches of farmland and wetlands on Yuen Long Plain, and Tin Shui Wai New Town behind the mountain. Wheelchair users are advised to enlist help from people nearby to slow the wheelchairs down before beginning the brief yet steep descent in the second half of the route. Not far away is the dam between the upper and lower reservoirs, where the views on each side contrast sharply with each other - on the left is the upper reservoir surrounded by hills and woodlands; on the right is the lower reservoir hidden under the canopy of leaves. The road continues as far as Ho Pui Tsuen, but given the considerable distance and the steep slopes, it is best to take the return trip at the end of the dam."
T104,P06,Tai Lam Nature Trail,West New Territories,3,3,2,2,10,4,"Having the longest span among all other nature trails in the country parks in Hong Kong and featuring many undulating sections, Tai Lam Nature Trail is only suitable for the fit and experienced. The trail introduces the flora and fauna, the cultural history, and the geological landforms in the area. It also offers views of Pak Kung Temple, which was built by villagers in Yuen Long, Kat Hing Bridge, which was constructed in the late 19th century, Rhodoleia, which is a native plant that blossoms in early spring, and Romer’s Tree Frogs, which are about the size of a thumb. Since the suction discs of their digits are underdeveloped, this species seldom climbs trees; they are usually seen on the ground thick with fallen leaves. One of the turns of the footpaths commands the vistas of Tai Lam Chung Reservoir, which is also known as Thousand-island Lake. Before the Second World War, inside the valley there was a village called Tai Lam, which is now submerged by the reservoir. The stream that enters the valley is named Tai Lam Chung. The picturesque setting has become a popular social media check-in spot among hikers."
T105,P12,Tai Long Wan Hiking Trail,Sai Kung,4,3,2,4,12,5,"Starting at Sai Wan Pavilion, this immensely popular hiking trail first traverses Sai Wan and then Ham Tin Wan, both of which face the Pacific Ocean. It never ceases to amaze visitors with such landforms as streams and estuaries as well as turquoise water and fine sand. In addition, the path that connects Sai Wan and Chek Keng is composed of strata formed by volcanic activities in Sai Kung around 140 million years ago. Volcanic activities were active and extensive here in ancient times, as evidenced by the changes of the strata that are easily noticed on the cliff face and rocks."
T106,P21,Tai Mei Tuk Family Walk,North New Territories,1,4,1,2,1,0.67,"Tai Mei Tuk is located on a promontory of Plover Cove, which is encircled on three sides by mountains. In the 1960s the then Director of Water Supplies Department T.O. Morgan proposed linking Pak Sha Tau, Tai Mei Tuk with a 2-kilometre dam to cut off the cove from the sea, making it the world’s first reservoir in the ocean. To many, a stroll along the dam is almost a must-do activity, but at the same time the family walk here seems to have been forgotten. Tai Mei Tuk Family Walk is a one-kilometre circular walk that passes through four viewing points overlooking the reservoir, and looking out on the mountain range of Pat Sin Leng in North East New Territories, and Plover Cove and Ma Shi Chau in the south. There are also twelve columns representing the Chinese zodiac animal signs along the trail. They can only be found on this trail, so don’t forget to look for the one you were born under."
T107,P03,Tai Mo Shan Family Walk,West New Territories,1,2,1,2,0.5,0.33,"Located inside Rotary Park, Tai Mo Shan Family Walk is a circular walk that skirts along a forest. The stone-paved path is easy and short, taking no more than half an hour to finish. Varying from season to season, the scene of viewing point is particularly extraordinary. On a clear day, we can look out on the cityscape of Tsuen Wan and Tsing Yi; on a misty day, the trail is like a fairyland as the vistas become faintly visible. Moreover, it is a good place for parents to teach their children about common native trees in Hong Kong – in spring Schima, an insect repelling tree with hard trunks and branches as well as poisonous bark, is in full blossom, but be careful not to touch it; in winter the leaves of Sweet Gum turn from yellow to red."
T108,P02,Tai Po Kau Nature Trail,North New Territories,2,3,2,2,1,1,"If you want to explore the rich biodiversity of forests, there is no better place than Tai Po Kau Nature Trail. Located inside Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve, the trail is a home to more than a hundred species of trees, and many of which are native to Hong Kong, hikers can find Fragrant Litsea easily along the trail. The oil extraction and the liquid in its fruits can be used to make a fragrance and insect repellent respectively. Another example of native species is Giant Bean, which displays characteristics of both trees and vines. It attaches to a tree before extending to another tree through the air like jumper cables. There are many of them in the forests but it is difficult to find their origins. The trail is surrounded by luxuriant secondary forests, with many Chestnut Oak. They were cut down for making farming tools and now grow freely in the forests. The fallen leaves from them covered the stone-paved path, as if they are trying to take over the earth by removing all traces of human existence. The unspoiled natural environment houses a variety of birds in all seasons. Some common species all the year round include Chestnut Bulbul, Silver-eared Mesia, and Grey-chinned Minivet. In winter, you could meet Grey-backed Thrushes and wagtails. In spring and summer, owls, cuckoos, and Hainan Blue Flycatcher are here for you to discover in the forest."
T109,P04,Tai Tam Country Park (Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir) Accessible Route,Hong Kong Island,1,5,1,1,3.1,1.5,"One can never overemphasise the beauty of the Tai Tam Group of Reservoirs. They are a group of 4 reservoirs, namely, in chronological order of their respective completion from 1888 to 1917, Tai Tam Upper Reservoir, Tai Tam Byewash Reservoir, Tai Tam Intermediate Reservoir and Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir. Built in the hope of tackling population explosion and hygienic problems like plague, they are one of the 6 prewar reservoirs in Hong Kong and have completely retained the superb waterworks design and craftsmanship of that time. Twenty-two of the historic waterworks, including the four masonry arch bridges built in the British style, have been declared monuments. Anyone with special needs intending to admire the beauty need not worry - the entire forest track is flat and there is a accessible toilet at the start point."
T110,P04,Tai Tam Country Trail,Hong Kong Island,3,2,3,4,2.6,1.5,"Not only does Tai Tam Country Trail offer a getaway from the hustle and bustle, but also a glimpse of the historic waterworks structures in Wong Nai Chung Reservoir Park, which was converted from Wong Nai Chung Reservoir constructed in 1899. The park has preserved three declared monuments, including the masonry dam, the valve house and the weir. The trail follows the stone steps on the left of the catchwater and leads up to Violet Hill, which looks out on coastal views over Brick Hill and Lamma Island, as well as the cityscape of Central, Wan Chai, and Hong Kong Parkview. At Chinese New Year, the peak commands an excellent vista of the northern slope dotted with native Chinese New Year Flowers in full bloom. On the way descending to Tai Tam Reservoir Road, you can even admire the thumb-sized Chinese New Year Flowers at close range, as they hang on the trees like pink bells."
T111,P04,Tai Tam Family Walk,Hong Kong Island,1,3,1,1,1.6,1,"Hiking trails in Hong Kong are an oasis of serenity in the urban jungle. Among them is Tai Tam Family Walk, one of the best places to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. The family walk is easily accessible by public transport. To get to the starting point, walk from Hong Kong Parkview along Tai Tam Reservoir Road for 15 minutes. The middle section of the walk features many common plant species, including Don Blue Berry and Hong Kong Camellia. Towards the end are the picturesque vistas of the reservoir, which is a highly expected spot for photo taking among many visitors. The viewing point offers a picture-postcard scene, with a panoramic view of the Tai Tam Group, which comprises Tai Tam Upper Reservoir, Tai Tam Byewash Reservoir, Tai Tam Intermediate Reservoir, and Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir, and black kites flapping their wings in the air. Although the walk towards Tai Tam Reservoir Road may be a bit physically demanding, it is still worth it, as visitors will be rewarded with the chance to admire the British architectural style of the reservoir."
T112,P04,Tai Tam Tree Walk,Hong Kong Island,1,3,1,1,0.07,0.3,"Tai Tam Tree Walk is about 70m in length, which is the shortest tree walk in Hong Kong country parks. With 12 interpretation plates installed along the Tree Walk introducing trees including Emarginate-leaved Ormosia, Itea and Lingnan Garcinia, it is a good place to learn about common trees. While you can learn the basic information of native trees from interpretation plates, you may admire the beauty of trees with distinctive features in different seasons."
T113,P10,Tai Tan Country Trail,Sai Kung,2,3,2,2,6.7,2.75,"Hong Kong, surrounded by water on three sides, possesses clear and beautiful coastlines.  Offering unique and varying vistas of the coasts in Sai Kung, the rocky Tai Tan Country Trail consists of shady hiking trail, footpaths near streams, and gravel paths.  It is a feast for the eyes as it is home to mangroves where hikers can get a close look at mudskippers and fiddler crabs and to a variety of species of butterflies, including Common Mime, Banded Tree Brown, and Plum Judy.  Moreover, visitors will never get bored as they can watch Sharp Peak, Ko Lau Wan, and Tap Mun in the distance along the trail.  The twisty path along the coast to Nam Fung Wan passes through Lan Lou Au and Hoi Ha Wan.  The good water quality, together with mild and gentle waves at the area, provides habitats for marine lives such as corals, coral reef fish, starfish, and jellyfish.  With a rich biodiversity, Hong Kong is a true gem which deserves love and protection."
T114,P10,Tai Tan Tree Walk,Sai Kung,1,3,1,1,0.23,0.3,"Tai Tan Tree Walk is a circular route with a length of 230m. It starts from Pak Tam Road and is adjacent to Wong Shek Tree Walk. The Tree Walk encircles a barbecue site and an outing site, with a campsite nearby. The Tree Walk is lined by 17 common tree species with interpretation plates introducing Myrobalan and Ivy Tree, for example. It also highlights tree species like Brisbane Box and Taiwan Acacia which were used in early afforestation practice."
T115,P06,Tai Tong Nature Trail,West New Territories,2,3,2,3,3.2,2,"It would be no exaggeration to say that Tai Tong Sweet Gum Woods is where the craze for Sweet Gum trees started. In winter, the leaves of Sweet Gum trees turn red and can be seen in the nearby Tai Tong Nature Trail, which is not lined with Sweet Gum trees though. The trail also overlooks Yuen Long Plain, the largest local alluvial plain, and Tin Shui Wai New Town in the north. Across the streams, there are rows of caged stone retaining walls. Constructed with stones enclosed by iron grids, these walls are particularly used in trails in the countryside as they can prevent rain wash and loss of soil, and the crevices are great rooting places for vegetation. The footpath can connect to Yuen Tsuen Ancient Trail, which was once a major route for villagers of Shap Pat Heung to transport farm produce to Tsuen Wan Market. The verdant forests we see today were once a borrow area and an infertile land. It was only after years of afforestation work that the area is revitalised. Visitors planning to go on a hike there should note that the trail is undulating and therefore requires a certain level of physical fitness."
T116,P06,Tai Tong Tree Walk,West New Territories,1,3,1,1,0.65,1,"Adjacent to Tai Tong BBQ Site No.1, Tai Lam Country Park, Tai Tong Tree Walk is only 650m long and built with 9 interpretation plates. Trees of exotic species such as Brisbane Box used for early afforestation effort are featured. Hong Kong Orchid's (city flower of Hong Kong) close relative, Camel’s Foot Tree is also introduced. A stroll along the Tree Walk enables you to relive the legends of Hong Kong at different times."
T117,P15,Tei Tong Tsai Country Trail,Lantau,1,3,1,2,2,0.75,"Has the question of the location of the renowned Po Lam Monastery ever come to your lips? Po Lam Monastery, situated at the ending point of Tei Tong Tsai Country Trail, is not accessible by vehicles.  Visitors can only get a view of the hidden and tranquil monastery after completing the trail on foot.  Connecting Tung Chung Road and Fa Mun Traditional Path near Pak Kung Au, Tei Tong Tsai Country Trail is merely 2 kilometres long and thus it provides family members of all ages with a desirable spot for family outing.  200 metres from the starting point of the trail lies East Lantau Stream, which merges 6 tributaries from the northeastern hills of Lantau Peak.  The all-year-round abundant flow guarantees visitors the magnificent sight in all seasons.  Around 300 metres ahead, hikers will be greeted with the wide and breathtaking views of Sunset Peak, Shek Sze Shan, Wo Liu Tun, and the Tung Chung alluvial plain in the north.  Once an important passage for villagers to travel between Tung Chung and Ngong Ping back in the old days, Fa Mun Traditional Path outside Po Lam Monastery leads visitors not only to Po Lin Monastery but also to a feeling of absolute serenity."
T118,P12,Tsiu Hang Nature Trail,Sai Kung,1,3,1,2,0.8,1,"Located inside the AFCD Lions Nature Education Centre, Tsiu Hang Nature Trail is an easy walk. You will be fascinated to explore the natural habitats through mosses, fungi (e.g. mushrooms), and the decomposing logs by the roadside. At the start point of the trail are series of host plants and nectar plants, not only attracting larvae of butterflies, but also tourists and photography enthusiasts in summer. There are also many special tree species, like Sweet Gum, Kaki Persimmon, Pandanus, Chinese White Olive, and Wax Trees, which can be used to make candles. However, do not touch the Wax Trees as their secretion may cause skin allergies."
T119,P03,Twisk Nature Trail,West New Territories,1,3,1,2,2,1,"If you take a look at photos taken in the 19th century, you will discover that mountains in Hong Kong were not covered in the lush green vegetation we see today. In fact, large scale of afforestation work was started by the government only after the Second World War. In order to improve fertility quickly, the majority of trees planted were fast-growing exotic species that are effective in preventing surface runoff and soil erosion. Some examples are Paper-bark Tree and Taiwan Acacia – the former, which originates in Australia and has thick and soft bark, can withstand both droughts and floods; the latter, which has diazotrophs in its roots, can improve soil conditions. Both of them can be found in Twisk Nature Trail, a circular trail that starts and ends at Tsuen Kam Au. Apart from a wide variety of flora, there is more to the trail. For example, it is home to Golden Orb-web Weaver and Stick Insect, which is known for their camouflage. It also looks out on Tai Mo Shan at the helipad, introducing the volcanic rock terrain of the highest mountain in Hong Kong."
T120,P23,War Relics Trail (Lion Rock and Ma On Shan),Central New Territories,3,4,3,2,9,4,"Some 80 years ago, Hong Kong witnessed the Battle of Hong Kong. Before the outbreak of the Second World War in the 1930s, the British military authorities constructed a defence line known as ‘the Gin Drinker’s Line’ along with such military installations as military marker stones, pillboxes, and trenches to defend against attacks from the enemy. With a span of 18 kilometres, the defence line stretches from Port Shelter, Sai Kung to the Kowloon hills, including Tate’s Cairn, Lion Rock, Beacon Hill, Shing Mun, Kam Shan, and Gin Drinker’s Bay (now Kwai Tsing), separating Kowloon from the New Territories. Starting at Gilwell Campsite near Tate’s Cairn and finishing at Beacon Hill, this trail is part of the defence line and there are 17 wartime ruins that tell the stories of the war at that time along the way. Some of them may look like just another massive rock, but are in fact the largest military stone markers discovered in Hong Kong up to now. Despite years of wind and rain, the markings on some of them are still clearly identifiable. However, many of these installations were destroyed by the British forces after the war, leaving the pillboxes in ruins. In addition to the military installations, there are numerous caves that were built during the Japanese occupation period. Kept in good conditions, they were originally built for possible attacks by the Allied Forces, but never came into use because in the end the war did not take place in Hong Kong."
T121,P16,War Relics Trail (Shing Mun),Central New Territories,1,2,1,1,0.25,0.5,"Many military relics of the Second World War in Hong Kong have survived into the present. The 250-metre war relics trail located on the slope of Smuggler’s Ridge of Shing Mun and Kam Shan Country Parks has a treasure trove of them. Built to defend against attacks from the north, it is an important stronghold of the Gin Drinker’s Line and features a series of defence infrastructure built before the Second World War (from around 1937 to 1938) by the British military authorities, including military marker stones, pillboxes, the defensive headquarters Shing Mun Redoubt, and some of the exits of its interconnecting tunnel system. The tunnels were named after the streets in London, like Oxford Street, Regent Street, and Shaftesbury Avenue.  The redoubt was ambushed by the Japanese army from Needle Hill on 9 December, 1941, and the Gin Drinker’s Line was breached the next day, forcing the garrison to retreat to Hong Kong Island. After capturing the redoubt, the Japanese soldiers carved the name of their group on the wall of Shaftesbury Avenue Tunnel. The relics also show that the ceiling of the observation post is still peppered with bullets, reminiscent of the considerable tension during World War II. Together with the smell of war, it is charged with an atmosphere of brutality and misery of war."
T122,P04,Wilson Trail (Section 1) Stanley Gap Road to Wong Nai Chung Reservoir,Hong Kong Island,3,3,3,4,4.8,3,"The uphill slopes on the Wilson Trail are too many to count, making it a trail to be reckoned with.  Soon after the first section of the trail starts, hikers have to climb over a thousand stone steps to scale the South Twins, which is 386 metres about sea level, and the North Twins, which is 363 metres above sea level. That being said, no matter how exhausted you are, be prepared to be rewarded with breath-taking scenery from the viewing platform – St Stephen’s Beach, Stanley Main Beach, D’Aguilar Peninsula, Lo Chau and, to the furthest, Po Toi Island.  In spring, you will see Common Melastoma in full bloom; in autumn and winter, the hillsides are studded with Hong Kong Gordonia like the starry sky.  Hiking trails are always fair in the sense that there are both uphill and downhill slopes.  The Twins are followed by a precipitous downhill slope leading to a valley flanked with trees and Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir, before going up again to Violet Hill.  At Chinese New Year, the peak commands the north side of the mountain dotted with Chinese New Year Flowers in full bloom, hanging on the trees like pink bells as large as a thumb.  When you reach the last section that descends to Wong Nai Chung Reservoir Park, you can even capture the delicate Chinese New Year Flowers at close range as a takeaway after finishing the first section of the Wilson Trail."
T123,P04,Wilson Trail (Section 2)Wong Nai Chung Reservoir to Lam Tin,Hong Kong Island,3,2,4,5,6.6,2.5,"The hiking trail starts from Hong Kong Parkview and is next to Wong Nai Chung Reservoir, which was built in 1899 and is one of the six reservoirs before the war. You can then amble away from the serenity of the Southern District into the mountains of the Eastern District. We, when in Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, may not be aware that the city is surrounded by mountains. Viewing from Jardine’s Lookout, you will see the towering skyscrapers, which have become miniatures, among the mountains, just like the local commuters who hope to squash into the train, Victoria Harbour. After trekking around Mount Butler Quarry, which stopped operation in 1991, you will see several rows of stoves made of red bricks upon arrival at the section which overlaps Quarry Bay Tree Walk. These stoves were built by the British Forces in preparation for a long battle against the enemy troops during WWII, but they did not come into play in the end. These stoves, as did the Osborn monuments at the start point, witnessed the Battle of Hong Kong in 1941."
T124,P19,Wilson Trail (Section 3) Lam Tin to Tseng Lan Shue,Sai Kung,3,3,3,3,9.3,4,"The Wilson Trail spans Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories, with the second section and the third being separated by Victoria Harbour. As the start point of Kowloon, the third section guides you through several war relics, including the site of the pillbox on Devil’s Peak, otherwise known as “Pau Toi Shan” (transliteration), meaning a fort in Chinese. In the past, Devil’s Peak had been occupied by pirates in the Qing dynasty and was once a hotbed of crime. It, therefore, became what the villagers living nearby called “Peak of Demons”, after which “Devil’s Peak” was translated into Chinese. That is how the current Chinese name of this mountain came into being. The pillboxes we can see today were constructed by “British Forces Overseas Hong Kong” to guard the eastern access to Victoria Harbour. Although the fort had been removed a long time ago, the circular pillbox, which has remained intact, is still attractive. The fort on the peak, which is not far away, is the gateway to an even wider view, making it an ideal sunset spot. Black Hill, the highest point of this section, commands Tseung Kwan O, whereas Tseng Lan Shue oozes yet another type of charm."
T125,P23,Wilson Trail (Section 4)Tseng Lan Shue to Sha Tin Pass,Central New Territories,3,3,4,3,8,3,"Victoria Peak is known as one of the best spots to enjoy the Hong Kong cityscape at night. However, not many people know Section 4 of the Wilson Trail offers comparable views, as you can watch the sun bid the city good evening and illuminate the entire Kowloon East from Tung Shan Pavilion. Stretching from Tseng Lan Shue to Sha Tin Pass, the route starts amidst cool woodland and a flat ancient trail that connects Ho Chung, Sai Kung to Kowloon. Once the main route for villagers to get to Kowloon, the ancient trail leads down to the village of Tai Lam Wu, where you can see the largest butterfly in Hong Kong, Common Birdwing with a bit of luck. The end of the catchwater marks the most difficult part of the section, which is also the part that ascends into the hills. The scenery up the hill is a stark contrast to that of the opening part; it offers a breathtaking panorama – in front are Fei Ngo Shan and Cheung Shan ranged in a line while at the back is the picturesque Pak Sha Wan. A brief walk from Fei Ngo Shan Road to Tung Shan will take you to a pavilion, which overlooks Kowloon East and former Kai Tak Airport, and boasts spectacular views of Lion Rock and Beacon Hill. Continue along Sha Tin Pass Road to Sha Tin Pass, and you will pass through Kwun Yum Temple, where, as the icing on the cake, you can drop by Lover’s Rock to pray for a happy marriage, before heading downhill towards Tsz Wan Shan."
T126,P23,Wilson Trail (Section 5)Sha Tin Pass to Tai Po Road,Central New Territories,2,3,2,1,7.4,2.5,"If you are an amateur hiker or looking for a family-friendly hike, this section, which enjoys views of much of Sha Tin, Tai Wai, Tolo Harbour, and as far as Ma On Shan, has you covered. Section 5 starts with a footpath that leads uphill for a kilometre before descending to the hillside, which makes up much of this section. As you walk along the catchwater on the hillside, look up to the left of the summit and you will see Amah Rock – its distinctive shape resembles a woman carrying a baby on her back watching for the return of her husband. The hillside is also a riot of colour, ablaze with a diversity of flora species, including Cape Jasmine, Ear-leaved Acacia, Honeysuckle, Schima, Climbing Bauhinia, and Gloryberry – scenery you do not see every day in the city. It later joins a fitness trail that connects to the finishing point, Tai Po Road."
T127,P23,Wilson Trail (Section 6) Tai Po Road to Shing Mun Reservoir,Central New Territories,2,3,2,1,5.3,2,"Traversing Kowloon Reservoir and Shing Mun Reservoir, Section 6 of the Wilson Trail offers a stunning spectacle not to be missed, with azure blue water and luxuriant trees complementing each other. As declared monuments, the structures of Kowloon Reservoir, including the main dam, the main dam valve house, and the recorder house, promote the appreciation of the history of Hong Kong’s water supply, part of which sheds light on how “Monkey Hill” got its name. It dates back to the construction of Kowloon Reservoir. It was found that the reservoir was threatened by the growth of a poisonous plant called Poison-nut, whose fruits, if consumed, could be lethal to humans but harmless to macaques, so the macaques were introduced to ensure the safety of fresh water. Since then, troops of macaques have lived together in harmony along the way from Tai Po Road to Shing Mun Reservoir. As a token of our gratitude to these guards, remember not to feed or intimidate them – this will keep the peace in the area."
T128,P16,Wilson Trail (Section 7)Shing Mun Reservoir to Yuen Tun Ha,Central New Territories,3,3,2,2,10.2,4,"Boasting majestic mountain scenery paired with magnificent reservoir views while being safe from the threat of tidal waves, the reservoirs in Hong Kong have always been ideal for locals who want a weekend getaway. Section 7 is a reservoir side path skirting Shing Mun Reservoir, where the spectacular scene when overflow is transferred to Lower Shing Mun Reservoir through its bellmouth overflow can be seen in the rainy season. In calm weather, the sight becomes even more awe-inspiring – the tranquil surface of water, tangled roots of Paper-bark trees on the opposite shore, as well as the reflection of Paper-bark trees in the water, all in front of your eyes. Set foot in Pun Han Pavilion and feast your eyes on the natural beauty of Paper-bark tree roots submerged in water in summer and lush greenery in winter. On the way to Yuen Tun Ha is Lead Mine Pass, a mine rich in tungsten and lead in former days. It sits at the junction of the MacLehose Trail and the Wilson Trail, where herds of cattle roam freely alongside hikers taking a rest. If you feel like a break, you may as well rest there."
T129,P03,Wilson Trail (Section 8) Yuen Tun Ha to Cloudy Hill,North New Territories,4,3,4,5,9,4,"Section 8 does not fall within the area of country parks and it starts at Sheung Wun Yiu, San Uk Ka. From there to King Law Ka Shuk, Tai Po Tau Tsuen, it is a cultural tour – as early as the Ming dynasty, the hills were once a kiln site because of its abundant water resources from Tai Mo Shan and rich deposits of porcelain clay in the soil; you can still find the preserved site behind Fan Sin Temple. As the trail ascends, it offers a panoramic view of Plover Cove Reservoir in the distance. Then, the trail widens as it gradually descends to a service reservoir, where you can enjoy an unobstructed view of Cloudy Hill. What follows is the real challenge – the climb to the Peak of Cloudy Hill can only be completed by going up flights of steps stretching out into the distance until they appear to meet the sky. To make it less arduous, take a rest at each of the five pavilions on the way. From the first pavilion, which overlooks Hong Lok Yuen, you can appreciate Hong Kong’s unique blend of the countryside and the city. The transmitting station of digital terrestrial television at the peak marks the finishing point of Section 8."
T130,P01,Wilson Trail (Section 9)Cloudy Hill to Pat Sin Leng,North New Territories,4,3,5,5,10.6,4.5,"Section 9 starts from the summit of Cloudy Hill and ends in Hsien Ku Fung, traversing Hok Tau Reservoir, Ping Fung Shan, and Pat Sin Leng. Absorb in the peace and tranquillity of the landscape at Hok Tau Reservoir before you take the footpath at the junction and embark on a journey to conquer the summits of Pak Sin Leng, one of the most difficult parts of the entire Wilson Trail. The cliff on the south face of Ping Fung Shan is like a screen between the North East New Territories and Tai Po. Travel along the ridge and feast your eyes on the 360-degree unobstructed panoramic views of the North East New Territories. Pat Sin Leng is a range of eight peaks, namely, in order from west to east, Shun Yeung Fung, Chung Li Fung, Kao Lao Fung, Kuai Li Fung, Tsao Kau Fung, Choi Wo Fung, Sheung Tsz Fung, and Hsien Ku Fung, each representing a Taoist immortal. On each of the peaks, there is a distinctive signpost for check-in."
T131,P01,Wilson Trail (Section 10)Pat Sin Leng to Nam Chung,North New Territories,4,3,4,5,6.8,2.5,"The last section is a scenic route as well as an easy hike. After descending from Hsien Ku Fung, the stone stairs lead down to Pat Sin Leng Nature Trail. Along the trail, you will wend your way through the deserted ancient village of Wang Shan Keuk Ha Tsuen, which has a well-preserved ancient border track that was once the main route to Bride’s Pool and Tai Mei Tuk. The track is also known as Wang Tsat Ancient Trail because it extends as far as Tsat Muk Kiu. Passing through Wang Shan Keuk Sheung Tsuen and Wang Shan Keuk Ha Tsuen, the trail leads to the Sir Edward Youde Memorial Pavilion, a rest area as well as a check-in spot. Erected in memory of Sir Edward Youde, who served as the 26th governor of Hong Kong, it commands the natural beauty of Starling Inlet and Nam Chung. Nam Chung is full of life, with many fish ponds, mudflats, and mangroves, which altogether make for an enjoyable hike."
T132,P07,Wong Lung Hang Country Trail,Lantau,3,3,5,4,2.3,1.75,"To embark on the journey, hikers set off in Tung Chung and pass through Chek Lap Kok New Village.  Thanks to the construction work of Hong Kong International Airport in Chek Lap Kok, Chek Lap Kok New Village and Tin Hau Temple, which was built in the third year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty (the year of 1822), were relocated to the current location.  The statues, doors, and incense burners, made of granite, are highly valuable from the historical and artistic perspectives.  Beginning next to Wong Lung Hang Picnic Site, Wong Lung Hang Country Trail starts off with countless stairs but later reward hikers with a close view of the well-known Wong Lung Fall and spectacular views of the Three Dragon Gorge, with the international airport on the northwest.  More than 20 tributaries from the uplands of Lin Fa Shan, Yi Tung Shan, and Sunset Peak converge and form Wong Lung Hang, which is named as such because every time after heavy rain, muddy water flows like a dragon that twirls in the gorge and dashes towards Tung Chung Bay.  Having its ending point located up at Sheung Tung Au, which is 690 metres high, the trail is demanding enough for hiking beginners.  After the physical challenge, then scenic beauty of Sunset Peak and Yi Tung Shan awaits."
T133,P12,Wong Shek Family Walk,Sai Kung,1,2,1,1,2,1,"Hailed as the ‘backyard of Hong Kong’, Sai Kung is a place of scenic beauty that can be fully appreciated along Wong Shek Family Walk. Located next to Wong Shek Pier, the family walk is gently undulating with long benches along the way and thus not physically demanding at all. Beyond the flight of dozens of stone steps, the beauty of Ko Tong Hau, To Kwa Peng, and Long Hill comes into full view. The view becomes even wider further up, extending to Long Harbour, Grass Island, Ko Lau Wan and Wan Tsai Peninsula. The atmosphere is pleasingly relaxed particularly on a clear day. Since the trail is right beside Wong Shek Pier, where a constant stream of small boats and sailboards pass by, it has breathed life into the coast of Sai Kung. With the views inside and outside the mountains complementing each other, this ‘backyard’ is full of vitality."
T134,P12,Wong Shek Tree Walk,Sai Kung,1,5,1,2,0.41,0.5,"Wong Shek Tree Walk is located in Sai Kung East Country Park, with a full length of 410m. It joins Wong Shek Family Walk and Pak Tam Road and is adjacent to Tai Tan Tree Walk. There are 12 interpretation plates to introduce common tree species found in the countryside such as Red Machilus, Rough-leaved Holly and Aporusa."
T135,P21,Wu Kau Tang Country Trail,North New Territories,2,2,2,2,2.4,1.25,"Feng Shui and numerology play an important role in Chinese culture.  Legend has it that Wu Kau Tang, initially named ‘Wu Kwai Tin’, which literally means ‘Tortoise Field’, was renamed so because of the negative connotation attached to tortoises; villagers in the New Territories replaced ‘Kwai’ with ‘Kau’, taking the auspicious meaning of the dragon and phoenix.  Today, around Wu Kau Tang there are stone tablets with markings that refer to ‘Wu Kau Tin’.  The trail also features a hill fire lookout, which looks out on the entire Sha Tau Kok Hoi, including Yim Tso Ha Egretry, A Chau Egretry, mangrove beds along Luk Keng coast, fish ponds, and paddy fields.  The vistas of mountain ranges on the northeast of Plover Cove Country Park also come into sight.  The beauty of the landscape aside, the trail offers glimpses of villagers’ wisdom of making use of raw materials around them, as evidenced by Castanopsis on the stairs – back in the era when food was scarce, villagers filled their stomachs with congee cooked with milled fruits of Castanopsis, whose local plants are still easily spotted around the area."
T136,P06,Yuen Tsuen Ancient Trail Country Trail,West New Territories,4,3,4,3,12.5,5.5,"Ancient trails used to be a key route for villagers to communicate and do trade with the outside world in the old days.  Many of them, including Nam Hang Pai Ancient Trail, Kap Lung Ancient Trail, and Yuen Tsuen Ancient Trail, lie inside Tai Lam Country Park, which also has the greatest number of country trails.  Linking Yuen Long with Tsuen Wan, Yuen Tsuen Ancient Trail has witnessed the time when villagers of Shap Pat Heung transported farm produce to Tsuen Wan Market.  The country trail also passes through the 400-metre Shek Lung Kung, which enjoys a 180-degree panorama of Tsing Yi, Rambler Channel, Ting Kau Bridge, Tsing Ma Bridge, and Lantau Island.  Tsing Ma Bridge, which opened in 1997, stretches for 1.377 kilometres, crossing Ma Wan Channel.  As one of Hong Kong’s architectural landmarks, the bridge was the world’s longest suspension bridge carrying road and rail traffic. The junction of the trail and Section Nine of the MacLehose Trail is Tin Fu Tsai Campsite, which was a resting point for commuters in days gone by.  Further along the shaded path is Kat Hing Bridge, which connects to the Sweet Gum Woods in Tai Tong, the finishing point of the trail.  In winter, the red leaves on the lines of Sweet Gum Woods in Tai Tong make for a great photography spot and give some welcome shade from the sun."
T137,P06,Yuen Tun Country Trail,West New Territories,3,1,2,2,9,4,"The Hakka form an integral part of indigenous residents of Hong Kong.  Nowadays, Hakka culture has died down but if you like to have a taste of the culture, Yuen Tun Country Trail is definitely the right place for you.  Yuen Tun, which was once a Hakka village, has now been transformed into the campsite of Civil Aid Service. Several village houses have been kept for the purpose of passing on the Hakka culture.  These houses have been rebuilt into Yuen Tun Museum, which, with reference to the way of life of the Hakka, displays exhibits of furniture and agricultural tools Hakka villagers once used, offering visitors a chance to time travel.  A Chinese couplet expressing travellers’ carefree moments is hung at the entrance of the village.  All the words in the poetic lines share the same radical “辵” and add up to profound meanings, making it a popular photography and social media check-in spot among hikers.  The section beyond Yuen Tun is mostly well-shaded path. Walking up the slope, visitors can view the beautiful scenes of Sham Tseng and Ma Wan when they take a backward glance.  When viewed from the mountain, Tsing Ma Bridge across Ma Wan and Tsing Yi looks exceptionally spectacular.  The higher visitors go, the broader the path gets, with a view of the scenic beauty of Tai Lam Chung Reservoir – something not to be missed."
