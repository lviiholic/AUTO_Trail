# Introduction
For Hongkongers, hiking is a way of life. According to the findings of the “Territory-wide Physical Fitness Survey for the Community” released previously, hiking was among one of the most popular physical activities for members of the public.

However, some people lack safety awareness, resulting in frequent accidents. In recent years, the number of fatal accidents and injuries related to hiking has risen, and the hiking season is starting again.

# Discover the Hiking Trails in Hong Kong

Hong Kong has a vivid hiking culture. From short nature trails to steep mountains, its Country Parks have something for everyone. These hikes cover Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, New Territories, Sai Kung, and the Outlying Islands.

> **Remarks**: A 5-star system is adopted for assessing the difficulty levels of hiking routes. 5-star represents the most difficult one. The assessment of individual trail conditions, including the “length”, “time required to finish the whole trip”, “gradient” and “surface condition” is tabulated.

# Raising Awareness of Hiking Safety 
Country parks provide hiking trails of various levels of difficulty for public use and enjoyment. Figures from the Fire Services Department (FSD) show that the number of rescue accidents in country parks has been on the rise over the past three years. Due to hiking accidents, some parks pose potential hazards. Hikers can use this information to plan and promote safety.

During the three-year epidemic period, Hong Kong people flocked to country parks for hiking, leading to a sharp increase in the number of rescue incidents.

| Year | Number of Rescue Requests Received | Increase from 2020 |
|------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| 2020 | 328                              | 0                  |
| 2021 | 588                              | 79%                |
| 2022 | 600                              | 82%                |
