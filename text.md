However, some people lack safety awareness, resulting in frequent accidents. In recent years, the number of fatal accidents and injuries related to hiking has risen, and the hiking season is starting again.

The assessment of individual trail conditions, including the “length”, “time required to finish the whole trip”, “gradient” and “surface condition” is tabulated.

## Raising Awareness of Hiking Safety 
Country parks provide hiking trails of various levels of difficulty for public use and enjoyment. Figures from the Fire Services Department (FSD) show that the number of rescue accidents in country parks has been on the rise over the past three years. Due to hiking accidents, some parks pose potential hazards. Hikers can use this information to plan and promote safety.
